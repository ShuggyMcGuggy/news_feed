There are tomes written about the best way forward. Stages, steps, processes–and in many cases—the “solution” is to plan more, track more, and deliver on time.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Business Agility is intended to be flexible. A goal of Agile Transformations is, in part, to gain the ability to adapt to what can be empirically shown to be true. While it is tempting to put a straitjacket on an organization and make sure that what is delivered is what was promised, the reality is that we may not actually want what we originally requested. The best solution may emerge as the problem and solutions are explored.</p>\n<p>Most organizations need to answer: how might we reach a business or product outcome when we may not understand what the outcome will look like? The answer lies in deciding where to constrain versus encourage action and, in fact, mandate creativity, complex thinking, and integrated solutions. No one can mandate creativity. However, we can set the stage for creativity to emerge.</p>\n<h3>MOVING FROM PROJECTS TO PRODUCTS</h3>\n<p>We are working with a large IT organization that has been working diligently to create a predictable software delivery pipeline for the last few years. To manage the pace of change effectively, we have to work through each part of it a few teams at a time. Until recently, financing for the organization came through business cases and project-based funding. The development groups relied on project-style requirements to tell them what to do next. The result was a software development organization that was Agile – but Business Agility was sorely lacking.</p>\n<p>In response, the IT organization embarked on a move from Projects to Products. This shift could have led the organization to a free-for-all where teams worked on what they thought was most valuable. The trick was to create responsible empowerment across all groups. If groups weren’t aligning to projects, what were they aligning to? And ultimately, whether we have a product or project focus, the goal is to deliver on strategic initiatives or bring to fruition strategic intent.</p>\n<h3>INTRODUCING OKR: OBJECTIVE &amp; KEY RESULT</h3>\n<p>One popular method of aligning work to strategic intent is the OKR or Objective and Key Result.</p>\n<p>In this last iteration of organizational change, the move was towards delivering more valuable work. The valuable work was defined as 1) strategically aligned and 2) delivering value to users and customers. LeadingAgile chose the humble yet powerful OKR (Objective and Key Result) format as the way to have a conversation between those working on software and the other levels of the organization tracking value.</p>\n<h3>PARTS OF THE OKR</h3>\n<p>OKRs have two main components:</p>\n<p><strong>Objective</strong>: What aspirational state do you want to reach?</p>\n<p><strong>Key Results:</strong> What is the measurable change in behavior or outcomes that the organization makes progress towards the objective? Behavior changes are not the act of ‘doing’ something. They reflect the change in behavior of the groups receiving the work.</p>\n<p>Other components can be added depending on the situation:</p>\n<p><strong>Initiatives:</strong> A set of actions to achieve key results</p>\n<p><strong>Outcomes: </strong>Lagging indicators that tell you the score once an objective is complete.</p>\n<h3>FIVE PRINCIPLES OF OKR</h3>\n<p>It’s the underlying principles of OKRs that make them great vehicles for communicating intent from the folks creating them. Here is a breakdown of why OKRs have become so popular – and are a significant component to add to your work expanding Business Agility.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h5>OKRs are created by the people who will do that work.</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>The people who do the work generate the OKRs. Yes, they undergo a review and discussion process, but they allow the person or group writing the OKR to determine the best way forward. When people choose their way forward, they are more motivated to complete the job well.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h5>Management can see the objectives that each part of the organization believes are most valuable to work on and prioritize.</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>OKRs bring excellent transparency to what each part of the organization is working on. Management can review that the components create a complete picture of all the aspects that groups are working with. And if necessary, they can locate specific areas where objectives are not aligned.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h5>Objectives are not hierarchical.</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Most organizations rely on cross-functional cooperation. OKRs can mirror that reality. One part of an organization can create objectives and key results linked to OKRs from anywhere within the organization. As long as it’s agreed that the objective is valid and valuable, where the work comes from is irrelevant.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h5>Objectives are written in the problem space.</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>The objective says: we will solve this problem. It leaves the detailed execution to emerge as solutions develop and evolve. This flexibility of solutions generates the Business Agility of the OKR driven organization.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h5>Key results are created with leading indicator metrics built into them.</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Keeping track of progress as work proceeds is another important reason OKRs are valuable. At each moment, the team can review how much progress has been made towards a key result and adjust effort and focus.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>OKRS IN PRACTICE</h3>\n<p>Here’s an example of how objectives and key results can start and evolve in practice:</p>\n<p>If my objective is to increase sales effectiveness, then one key result could start with attending training. In this example, attending training is considered an output. It states what I did but doesn’t tell me anything about the outcome. A way to align with the intent of the key result is to ask what results I want from attending training.

We see what our problems are—or at least some of them. But then what? “Let’s be Agile” isn’t as simple as snapping our fingers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe we haven’t taken any steps toward change yet because we don’t feel we can effect change in the organization to begin with. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or, maybe we do, and any conversations with leadership or colleagues make it seem like we can’t get aligned on how changes should be made, and if they should be made at all. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Often, we’ve already invested Agile training, thinking that if we just do the practices, it’ll resolve our issues as an organization. </span></p>\n<h3>Will Installing Agile Practices or Culture Make us Agile?</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s easy to buy into this method because it’s so simple to hire a SAFe trainer or go to Scrum school. Once we get people to adopt Agile practices and do them well, we think that will translate to doing better as an organization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there are some common obstacles that keep this from working, namely that it doesn’t show us how to know what our dependencies from across the organization are and how to coordinate and orchestrate with other teams to manage and remove them. We may have teams operating with Scrum, but they are still blocked by dependencies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Implementing practices into teams also doesn’t enable us to first think about how to align what our teams are doing with our customers and markets. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s true that Agile practices are part of becoming Agile. But dependencies kill Agility. So this isn’t going to work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or maybe we think if we start by changing the mindsets of the people in the organization—inserting Agile culture—they will begin to easily adopt the practices. And once we adopt the practices, we’ll see our impediments, and that will get us to break the impediments in our way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The thing is, when we overlay practices or culture on an already broken system, Agile doesn’t work, no matter what we insert on top of what’s already in place. </span></p>\n<h3>Focus On The Core Issue Instead</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The core issue with either of these starting points is that we&#8217;re overlooking the real problem: it’s the underlying system that&#8217;s broken. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The organization has to be adapted to the practices before the practices can work. Many of us may not think we can change the structure of the business or effect change in this way, so we don’t even consider it as a possible starting point. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the underlying business ecosystem is full of incongruence and competing priorities, lack of coordination across the organization, lack of ability to make decisions smoothly or at all, and a lack of ability to understand dependencies—we can’t ultimately coordinate and orchestrate and ensure we’re aligned with value. So how could we install something on top of such a system and expect it to work? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since we already know about many of the problems we have in our systems, we need to start by solving them and enabling those systems first. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can do this by anchoring on structure, governance and metrics. We design a knowable system by forming teams, operating off of known backlogs, at a stable velocity, in a model focused on small batches that are strategically aligned. Once that system is in place, we can enable it with the practices of Scrum, Kanban, etc. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we enable a realistic viable system by adding the right kinds of practices onto the right foundational ecosystem, we also end up getting the culture shift. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we start by first getting the structure, governance, and metrics aligned in a way that we know is going to deliver effective results—that’s when we start getting the business outcomes we want. And those outcomes are the real goal of Agile. </span></p>\n                    </div>\n</div><a href=\"https://engage.leadingagile.com/March-2022-Open-QA-Registration.html?utm_source=The%20One%20Thing%20We%20Must%20Change%20Before%20Agile%20Transformation%20Can%20Work&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=RSS%20CTA\" style=\"display: block; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.leadingagile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/open-qa-email-newsletter.jpg\" style=\"display: block; height: auto; margin: 0 auto;\" /></a><img src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/collect?v=1&amp;tid=UA-20144799-2&amp;cid=1647620438&amp;t=event&amp;ec=RSS&amp;ea=open&amp;cs=The%20One%20Thing%20We%20Must%20Change%20Before%20Agile%20Transformation%20Can%20Work&amp;cm=RSS_Feed&amp;cn=RSS_Opens\" />", "pub_date": "2022-03-03T14:20:19Z", "link": "https://www.leadingagile.com/2022/03/the-one-thing-we-must-change-before-agile-transformation-can-work/?utm_source=The%20One%20Thing%20We%20Must%20Change%20Before%20Agile%20Transformation%20Can%20Work&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS%20Reader", "image": "https://frozen-brushlands-72168.herokuapp.com/staticfiles/imgs/agile_pm.png", "podcast_name": "", "guid": "https://www.leadingagile.com/?p=60067", "comment": "", "status": null, "star_rating": 5}}, {"model": "podcasts.newsitem", "pk": 2420, "fields": {"source_name": "Field Notes – LeadingAgile", "title": "Growth Mindset: Criticism", "description": "<div class=\"flex flex--media\" id=\"flex-block-0\">\n    <div class=\"main main--expand\">\n        <figure class=\"media_wrap\">\n        <img alt=\"Growth Mindset: Criticism\" class=\"attachment-940x999 size-940x999\" height=\"529\" src=\"https://www.leadingagile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SoundNotes-Feat-Img-Mary-K-Criticism.jpg\" width=\"940\" />                                </figure>\n    </div>\n</div><div class=\"flex flex--content\" id=\"flex-block-1\">\n    <div class=\"sidebar\">\n            </div>\n    <div class=\"main\">\n        <p>This is the fourth episode in our series of podcasts about Fixed vs. Growth Mindset.

You prepare an annual operating plan outlining your budget and allocations every year. Once the dust settles and everything is agreed to, you are asked to do more with less. Everything after that is chaos.</p>\n<h3><strong>WHERE THE PLAN GOES WRONG</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Projects that you targeted did not start when you planned.</li>\n<li>Unplanned events, outages, and work eat at the money you planned to invest in a new value.</li>\n<li>Projects you started in prior years do not finish on time, and an ever-increasing body of work carries into the new year. Since this work is already committed, it erodes the amount of money and effort that can be applied to new, high-value products and features.</li>\n<li>You are met with a barrage of requests—large and small—from your customers, and their need outstrips your capacity to deliver. It’s difficult to prioritize these requests because there is no consistent definition of value, and nobody believes the business cases anyway.</li>\n<li>At some point, one or more frustrated customers will come to you with a pile of cash to execute their latest priority. But being given funds doesn’t magically make skilled, trained, and experienced resources appear to do the work. Inevitably you move around the same people who always get the job done, leading to more things being started but not finished.</li>\n<li>You are given unfunded mandates related to risk, compliance, and cyber security.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>HOW DID WE GET HERE?</strong></h3>\n<p>This sounds like a terrible fate. Unfortunately, it’s a fate that many companies struggle with every year.</p>\n<p>A primary cause for this is the belief that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Everyone agrees on priorities</li>\n<li>A year is defined by a set of projects</li>\n<li>The projects can be planned in detail</li>\n<li>The full scope of each project can be delivered on time</li>\n<li>The business will not change what it wants over the course of the year</li>\n<li>People can be moved around to address gaps</li>\n<li>People can be added on demand when funding becomes available</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every system (in this case, your “people system”) will deliver exactly what it is designed to deliver.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong>What if we could organize that system in such a way to make execution aligned to the most important objectives the company has? Could we create an annual funding plan but use it to adaptively deliver a higher density of value? Can we organize ourselves as stable, high-performing, cross-functional teams? Can we develop the muscles to change our allocation of investments to meet the emerging needs of the business? What if everyone in the company was operating against a small, clear set of objectives with measures that show if they will be achieved and provide feedback loops to adapt to change?</p>\n<p>The answer is yes! It is possible to plan finances for the year while being crystal clear on strategic objectives and achieving them.</p>\n<h3><strong>WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT?</strong></h3>\n<p>First, it is necessary to believe that a year is not defined by a list of projects but rather by an Investment Strategy<em>:</em> an organization of stable, cross-functional teams with aligned value, funded for reasonable intervals against strategic objectives.</p>\n<p>One definition of strategy is the alignment of necessarily finite resources against potentially unlimited aspirations. What is important is not whether projects are finished but whether business objectives are being met.</p>\n<p>These are some questions we ask:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are we growing our most important markets?</li>\n<li>Do we understand our customers and their problems?</li>\n<li>Can we provide solutions to those problems?</li>\n<li>Do we have effective designs for those solutions?</li>\n<li>Can we deliver those solutions?</li>\n<li>Are there feedback loops all along the way to listen and respond?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>ESSENTIALS FOR AGILITY: TEAMS, BACKLOGS, AND WORKING TESTED PRODUCT</h3>\n<p>At LeadingAgile, we have distilled the concepts of agility down to the very essentials: Teams, Backlogs, and Working Tested Product. The fundamental unit of agility is a stable, cross-functional <em>Team</em> that has everything it needs to deliver. <em>Backlogs</em> provide clarity on what the team needs to accomplish so that it is always working on the most important things. A high-performing team with a clear backlog can frequently deliver <em>Working, Tested Product</em>.</p>\n<p>At the scale of an enterprise, these same concepts become Structure, Governance, and Metrics. We create a <em>Structure</em> of Portfolio, Product, and Delivery Teams aligned to value. We define the <em>Governance</em> rules that control how value flows through that <em>Structure</em>. At each step, we have a set of <em>Metrics</em> that show how the system is operating and whether the objectives are being achieved.</p>\n<h3>IMPLEMENTING YOUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY &amp; INVESTMENT TEAM</h3>\n<p>This is where the investment strategy comes to play. When we are mature enough in this system, we can fund it based on products and not projects. Fundamental to this is creating an <em>Investment Team</em> (larger organizations may have more than one).</p>\n<p>An <em>Investment Team</em> is a group of executives responsible for setting the company&#8217;s overall direction in a language the System of Delivery can optimize against. This team is cross-functional like all the other teams and meets on a monthly and quarterly cadence to gauge the quality of strategic themes and the progress towards achieving them.</p>\n<p>This team resolves prioritization concerns from portfolios, makes high-level tradeoffs, and applies resources to constraints to improve flow when bottlenecks are identified. The Investment teams focus on ensuring that the System of Delivery (SOD) can align with overall business objectives using OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) and that the supply in the SOD matches the ambition of the objectives. The team is responsible for the overall decisions on funding &amp; capacity within the portfolios.​</p>\n<p>The Investment Team creates a new way of working, a system inherently designed to align business outcomes with crisp execution. This system is characterized by clear decision boundaries and rapid feedback and response. In addition to delivery structures, it creates a business structure focused on​ becoming risk and dependency-aware, balancing capacity and demand, making work visible, ensuring​​ predictable throughput, and identifying high-value items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implementing OKRs at the top level of the organization to establish business goals and outcomes rather than solutions and outputs to drive the conversations.​</li>\n<li>Establishing a capability-based foundation for knowledge, decisions, and feedback.​</li>\n<li>Utilizing asset allocation mix strategies to respond to market demands and achieve business outcomes.<em>​</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Annual budgets are a given–the company must plan its finances on an annual horizon. But we can create a system of Structure, Governance, and Metrics that, guided by an Investment Team, can rationally allocate resources against objectives and break the vicious cycle of a year defined by projects rather than value.</p>\n                    </div>\n</div><a href=\"https://engage.leadingagile.com/March-2022-Open-QA-Registration.html?utm_source=Why%20Your%20Annual%20Operating%20Plan%20Is%20A%20Lie%20and%20What%20To%20Do%20About%20It&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=RSS%20CTA\" style=\"display: block; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.leadingagile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/open-qa-email-newsletter.jpg\" style=\"display: block; height: auto; margin: 0 auto;\" /></a><img src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/collect?v=1&amp;tid=UA-20144799-2&amp;cid=1647620438&amp;t=event&amp;ec=RSS&amp;ea=open&amp;cs=Why%20Your%20Annual%20Operating%20Plan%20Is%20A%20Lie%20and%20What%20To%20Do%20About%20It&amp;cm=RSS_Feed&amp;cn=RSS_Opens\" />", "pub_date": "2022-02-23T16:42:18Z", "link": "https://www.leadingagile.com/2022/02/why-your-annual-operating-plan-is-a-lie-and-what-to-do-about-it/?utm_source=Why%20Your%20Annual%20Operating%20Plan%20Is%20A%20Lie%20and%20What%20To%20Do%20About%20It&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS%20Reader", "image": "https://frozen-brushlands-72168.herokuapp.com/staticfiles/imgs/agile_pm.png", "podcast_name": "", "guid": "https://www.leadingagile.com/?p=60059", "comment": "", "status": null, "star_rating": 5}}, {"model": "podcasts.newsitem", "pk": 2422, "fields": {"source_name": "Field Notes – LeadingAgile", "title": "Why Culture-First or Practice-First Agile Transformations Don’t Work", "description": "<div class=\"flex flex--media\" id=\"flex-block-0\">\n    <div class=\"main main--expand\">\n        <figure class=\"media_wrap\">\n        <img alt=\"Why Culture-First or Practice-First Agile Transformations Don’t Work\" class=\"attachment-940x999 size-940x999\" height=\"529\" src=\"https://www.leadingagile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Systems-First-Blog.jpg\" width=\"940\" />                                </figure>\n    </div>\n</div><div class=\"flex flex--content\" id=\"flex-block-1\">\n    <div class=\"sidebar\">\n            </div>\n    <div class=\"main\">\n        <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our industry, we notice there are typically two ways people want to approach Agile Transformation. Either they want to add in practices like Scrum of SAFe and go from there, or try to shift the culture through beliefs and mindsets first. The trouble is, neither of these really works. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Inserting Agile Culture First</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a very commonly held belief that if we can change the beliefs and the mindsets of the organization, people will adopt the practices. Once they adopt the practices, then that will get us to break the impediments necessary to get us working in an Agile way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We expect that leaders will start to delegate authority and push the work down to the people most able to do the work. We think this will work because we want to empower and trust our people, and not be “command and control.” Maybe we have consultants come in and do mindset or beliefs training, etc. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea is if we can let the people closest to the ground decide how to do the work, then we will be able to operate with greater Agility. The problem is that this doesn’t produce benefits quickly enough, even if you somehow miraculously do get 5,000 people to do it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Culture first is a great idea. But in reality, it doesn’t work. How do you get all the hearts and minds to change and then align into an operating model that’s going to produce the business results you want without injecting chaos into the organization? This may work at a small scale in a very small company or team, but at a large scale, you simply won’t get the alignment sufficient to then get practice adoption sufficient and your impediments organically removed fast enough to demonstrate business results. It’ll fall apart before you ever get there.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Implementing Agile Practices First</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternatively, we think it sounds easier to install Agile practices first. This one is easy to buy into because it’s so easy to hire a SaFE trainer, or go to Scrum school. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea is that we can take the organization in place and teach it the mechanics of Scrum or SAFe. Then when we start doing the practices, they will show us our organizational impediments, technology architecture problems, organizational design problems, governance problems, leadership problems, and so forth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By doing the practices at the team level and removing our impediments we’re going to get the systems changes we want in our structure, governance, and metrics. If we just learn the practices, then the systems will emerge and our culture will begin to change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In reality, what we find is that the impediments are quite often outside the purview of a Scrum team, so on the ground the practices start bending to the immutable systems within the organization. Scrum and SAFe aren’t adaptable to the organization. The organization has to be adapted to the practices. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you add practices overlaid on a broken system, not only does it create cynicism around those practices, but the culture is never going to emerge because there’s so much incongruence because the system doesn&#8217;t work.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Creating a Foundation of Systems First </b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea behind a systems-first Transformation is that we know the kinds of problems in systems that are out there. So why don’t we start by enabling those systems? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What we want to do is anchor on The Three Things: teams, backlogs and working tested product, which at scale become structure, governance, and metrics. Our hypothesis is that if we can get teams formed, operate off of known backlogs, at a stable velocity, in a model focused on small batches, that are strategically aligned—we design a knowable system. That system is where we start.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then we enable that system with practices like Scrum, Kanban, etc. at each layer. If we enable a realistic viable system with the right kinds of practices, what we end up doing is getting the culture shift we want over time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, it’s true that no matter what, there has to be a culture change eventually. So if we want to answer the question of how do we get culture to change at scale? We get there by first getting the structure, governance, and metrics sorted out. Then let the culture follow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you start by first getting the system aligned in a way that you know is going to deliver effective results, teach the right practices at each level of the organization based on what they do, and then coach the culture so it changes over time—that’s when you’ll start getting the business outcomes you want because your Transformation will actually work.</span></p>\n                    </div>\n</div><a href=\"https://engage.leadingagile.com/March-2022-Open-QA-Registration.html?utm_source=Why%20Culture-First%20or%20Practice-First%20Agile%20Transformations%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Work&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=RSS%20CTA\" style=\"display: block;

Listen now.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://agiletoagility.com/podcast/\">Agile to Agility Website</a></p>\n<h4>Transcript:</h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">00:29</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Who is Mike Cottmeyer and what’s been your journey?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">00:33</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Okay, well, that’s a big question, man, who is Mike Cottmeyer? Well okay, well, I’ll take it from a professional angle. So, I’m the CEO of a company called Leading Agile, started about 11 years ago, I’m based in Atlanta, Georgia. We’ve gotten pretty big over the last couple years, we’re about 160, almost 270 people, we focus almost exclusively on Agile Transformation. More often than not in kind of either the IT product development space or IT services space. We like to consider ourselves kind of a full stack consultancy in the sense that you know, obviously, you have to deal with the work surface levels and what the teams are doing but you know, how do you orchestrate teams across dependency boundaries? How do you go up into Portfolio Management? How do you go up into investment management, that kind of a thing? What do you do with audit and compliance? What do you do with planning cadences? What do you do with Enterprise Architecture like, the whole thing, right? So like, what we really do is, I like to think of us as like, we kind of refactor organizations to be able to operate with more business agility, right, in a nutshell. And then aside from that, you know, I’m a dad, a husband, I have three boys, you know, so it’s basically family and work for the most part, for me.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">01:53</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You got a lot of guitars and are those guitars in the background?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">01:56</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I do, I play guitar. So I actually, as soon as I said that, I went well, it’s not 100% try skill at hand. I play guitar and I did jiu-jitsu and I’ve been kind of on a bit of a fitness journey for the last couple of years as well. So yeah, but the hobby is all kinds of very, guitars have been persistent in my life since I was about 12 years old. Yeah.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">02:13</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nice. How did you get into this agile space? You said, you’ve been doing this 11 years but I’m sure it’s more than that. Like, how did you end up?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">02:21</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yeah, well, back in the early 2000s. Well, I guess, you know I spent the first 10 years of my career mostly in IT infrastructure. So like, literally like 19, to about like, 30 or so and then, so I guess 30 put us in the early 2000s. And you know, the manifesto had just been written and I was working as a project manager in a company called CheckFree here in Atlanta and squarely like in the PMO. But I had always kind of adapted practices, project management practices to deal with variation because like, my worldview was that things were not as certain as the Gantt chart implied, kind of view. And so, I was working on this company called Check free in the PMO, doing PMI style project management and I was working with development teams and there was a guy who’s on my team now named Brian Sondergaard, who I worked for. And we were going back and forth on some things and so I inquired, I like, what do you guys like, tell me, what do you guys formally doing and they were doing they said it was extreme programming at the time.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But what they’re really doing was like scrum with technical practices and things like that, I ever more aligned, it felt like to me was Scrum. And so, I built a relationship with this dev director that I was working with and he and I would collaborate and I was reading books and you know, reading all the Kent Beck stuff, <span class=\"s2\">[unsure 03:48]</span>. There were so a lot of guys writing kind of in the rough space and scale project management space, agile project management space, that time Jim Highsmith write on that kind of stuff. And then so the same guy, Brian Sondergaard, ended up coming in working for him in his dev organization and we just started doing some really cool stuff with Agile program portfolio management. We were inventing a lot of things, taking David Anderson’s work on Kanban and agile management stuff that he was doing and literally building like, what you would recognize now is like, early versions of safe, you know here frameworks and like flow based management systems at the higher tiers. And so, it’s that for a couple years, that group reorganized and I kind of find myself back in a regular PMO and I’m like, that’s not cool, right?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At that point I said that, no disrespect to PMOs out there but it’s like, we’ve done so much cool stuff like I just couldn’t go backwards. Right? And then, so I ended up going to work for Version One for a little bit and that was like my first introductory to like a pure play agile organization and I was on the team that went in, trained and consulted. And what was super cool about that was and I know a lot of practitioners are listening to this, will recognize it, when you have a tool, the tools are typically designed to work in an agile way. And if you’re working with an organization that’s not really structured for agility, like you start to recognize there’s a lot of stuff that’s broken and you have kind of two choices. You either change the tool to accommodate the organization or you change the organization and unfortunately, most of the companies that we were dealing with, didn’t have agency or influence to change the organization.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But I started writing a lot about what I would do and I started doing talks about what I do. And the cool thing about Version One is like, any talk, any conference I can get accepted to, they let me go speak and I was off speaking. Yes, going to conferences, building networks, you know, meeting with people I got to meet, you know, people who were like my heroes like, Jim Highsmith and Alastair Coburn and Christopher <span class=\"s2\">[unsure 05:55]</span> and Joshua Kerievsky and you know, Kent Beck and like all these guys, right? And was fortunate to become friends with some of them through the years, right which is pretty cool to become friends with your heroes a little bit. Literally standing on the shoulders of giants, left out Mike Cohn, never really became buddies, duster dirty, you know, just all those luminaries of our field just consumed everything, right? And I was just writing and writing and speaking and stuff and then you know, when joined a company called Pillar Technology for about a year, ended up not being a great move for me personally but great company or fine.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sold to Accenture, I think and then loving years ago launched leading agile and stated goal is I wanted to make, I want to double my salary and work part time but I failed miserably. For 11 years, became a CEO and learned a ton about stuff I’d never want to learn about like, banking and <span class=\"s2\">[unsure 06:57],</span> benefits and investment strategies and you know, growth and SGMA and cost of goods sold and all kinds of stuff like that, yeah. Trying to keep the company as agile as it can possibly be so like, we try super hard to organize in ways very similar to how we ask our customers to organize and manage their processes, empower the people and you know, distribute decision making and try not to be super commanding control. And you know, that kind of a thing so we try to do what we say to do, right and we try to be that way.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">07:30</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yeah, that is awesome. I think you know, obviously I know they prior and you know, I’ve known other people that worked and it’s you know, from Leading Agile, at least what I’ve heard people that work for Leading Agile. Like, the way that you engage with your clients is, you know, focus more on coaching, focus more on meeting people where they are in companies. And I want to kind of go back to something that you mentioned which is, you said you refactor organizations. And I want to go to a topic, I haven’t discussed this with anybody on the podcast, I’ve done business architecture. And I want to start there and then we can kind of go down but from your perspective and you said something that’s related to this, you said, if your systems and capabilities are not aligned to your products and customers, your practices don’t matter. So, I want to come back to that but could you just maybe for those that are not familiar with what business architecture is, could you maybe just describe it?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">08:28</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Well, so we’re in an interesting phase of Leading Agile where we have people that are deep experts in things that are not deep experts in. And so, like the Stevens who was one of my early, like, co founder kind of people, deep expertise in business architecture, I kind of think I’m just kind of a business architecture hobbyist, right? But in principle, what we’re talking about with business architecture, is we look at the organization not through the lens of what the people do or what their function is but more through the lens of what are the services that the business provides. And so like, the analogy I use, the reason why I talk about refactoring is because I think there’s like a really strong metaphor here. It’s like when you take like a legacy monolith and you want to like move to the cloud or do DevOps or something like that, right?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You can’t pull the whole monolith up and put it in a cloud, right? What you end up doing is you’re pulling out services and you end up encapsulating services and you put encapsulated services, service boundaries and contracts and all those things, you move that to the cloud, right kind of thing? And that’s what a lot of organizations are like, but it’s people and structures and processes and org design and things like that. And so, what when we do an early stage transformation, I actually don’t bring typically agile coaches. I mean, everybody’s like very familiar with Agile and Scrum and things like that but I wouldn’t call them agile coaches per se. We typically do in early stage like a startup engagement where the business architect and somebody who’s like really, like a product person but probably a little different than most people would think. Like, so we go in and we will literally do like business capability models, heat maps at your organization.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">10:13</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And then I’m assuming this is somebody like pretty high up like, C.O.O. Like, because those are the people that have usually authority to make these type of changes, right or is it somebody like?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">10:22</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yeah. Well, that’s probably an interesting angle. Right? So, one of the things that I talked about as a company and just from us is we have to be incredibly patient in our sales cycle. Because like, it all comes down to span of control and so, you know, so if you’re dealing with like a division, right, it might be like a division head, it could be a divisional C.I.O or Senior Vice President or Vice President is working with a business partner on that side nav, span of control over like a piece of the organization. But yeah, absolutely right, the kinds of changes that you have to make, have to be sponsored at the top because they’re not process changes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Process is part of it but like, you literally have to create a hypothesis organizationally for what you’re going to group people around. Right? And so, let me take it from the other side, like one of the, like I did a talk for the scrum gathering in Vegas, it had to have been, you know, eight, nine years ago at this point. But I did this talk called, ‘the three things’ and it was like, the three things you need to know to transform any organization. And the three things are just really simple, team’s backlogs, working test, the software and the way Scrum works, we know this, right? The way Scrum works is you have to have a dedicated team of people that own the product that are interfacing with like, a product owner who’s responsible for the backlog and they have to have the ability to produce a working tested increment, the end of every sprint, like period, hard stop. Right? And if you don’t have those conditions, then what starts to happen, right is you get teams that are breaking the rules of Scrum because they kind of have to, right? And so like, at the lowest level of the organization, you have to ask yourself is what is necessary to form a complete cross functional team that stays together over time. And what it is it comes down to is that you have to have a capability or a feature set or encapsulated service with technology boundaries, a dedicated team, a service owner or product owner and you have to have the deployment capabilities to produce a working tested increment at the end of every two weeks and that’s just true, right? And so, you can either kind of take the scrum approach that says, okay well, we’re going to start doing Scrum and then your impediments will reveal themselves and the impediments will get resolved by the scrum master. But in practice, right, that’s too low level to address these systematic issues.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">12:57</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Exactly. Because I think what happens is like, then the dependencies are exposed and you start seeing all of a sudden, all of these dependencies, you still have delivery issues, right?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">13:08</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For sure, right? For sure, and that’s really, so you hit the nail on the head, right? It’s like, its dependencies in some form of fashion at the end of the day, they get away, because you know, the Scrum and this is where safe comes in, it’s kind of interesting, right? So, what scrum came along and said was, okay, we’re going to encapsulate the dependencies inside the team. And we’re going to give the team agency to how to resolve those dependencies in real time, that assumes that the dependencies are encapsulated within the team. So now, when you have multiple Scrum teams that have dependencies between them, right, what’s safe came along and basically said was, well, I’m going to encapsulate the value stream and we’re going to put the boundaries of the dependencies between teams, within like a release train or a value stream or big room planning around it or any string between things and we’re going to do this stuff, right?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">What we find is really complex organizations, the value streams are not really encapsulate very well, either. Right? So, what do you do with dependencies between value streams, right? Now, the last guys right, Bassford, and <span class=\"s2\">[unsure 14:15]</span> you know, I think Dave actually got the model right. It’s like, you’ve got to break the dependencies, you got to put the right technical architecture and stuff but the challenge is that, it can take years in some of these organizations, right? That’s not a flip of the switch, even if you want to defund it, you couldn’t do it overnight, you couldn’t do it safely, quickly. It takes a minute, right.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">14:35</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It also takes people like, I think maybe it takes a lot of people to understand what needs to happen. Then maybe just to kind of add another thing here, which is reference architecture. So, we talked about business architecture, business architecture, just for to keep it simple, it has to do with organizational design, policies, essentially, how do you architect your organization, right? Like, you know, where does reference architecture, we’re not talking about IT reference architecture but business reference architecture fit in and what is your?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">15:10</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Well, let me tell you the way I usually use that word, right? So, there are organizational patterns that I think are universally true. Right? And I think safe and last, and maybe some other things like discipline, Agile Delivery, some of the stuff that like <span class=\"s2\">[unsure 15:28]’s</span> done with met objectives and I guess now he’s part PMI. A lot of what those people have built upon are really sound foundational principles, like encapsulated teams at the work surface level, Kanban or flow based kind of governance models on top, right, at a lean agile metrics that enable us to measure improvement, things like that. And so, I think there’s like a reference architecture to organizational design that I believe is true and I think it’s <span class=\"s2\">[cross-talking 16:01]</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">16:00</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But those are more like patterns, right? Like, they’re taking a bunch of, you know, patterns and just putting them together and viewing these frameworks around.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">16:09</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yeah. Well, that’s where I was going, right? And so, that’s always where I preface it, this is how I use the word reference architecture, right? It’s like those base patterns, the base structures, the rules of operation, just the things that we just know to be inherently true. It might be like a design pattern, like if you read a design patterns book in code, right, and I’m not a coder because I can’t write a bunch of stuff off. But like, these design patterns are universally true and then they get implemented in an organization. Right? And then all of those patterns get instantiated into an operating model for that organization and this is my challenge with last and Scrum and some of these other things is, I think all of them are built on incredibly sound reference architecture but they’re overly specific in their reference implementation.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">16:58</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Correct. So essentially, instead of dealing with complexity, where like, instead of the reference architecture being fixed, which save has a picture and then all of these. Instead of like, leveraging those patterns and almost evolving that architecture, so that architecture has to be emergent, rather than fixed, right?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">17:16</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Also, so Dean has like, a couple of, you know, for what he’s trying to build, right? The challenge with kind of going down the path that we go down is that it’s really difficult to scale. Right? The fact that I’m in 160 ,170 people is mind boggling to me, that’s really tough, right? But like what, so Dean kind of, at least this is my understanding from the outside of that organization, what they’ve really done is they’ve packaged a reference implementation that basically gives people guidance. It’s a little bit like the rough days, where it’s like, these are practices that are good for most people, most of the time, we fully expect you to tailor them, right?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But the certification is around the implementation details and you know, like most people, even with Scrum, it’s like, you go to a certification class and it isn’t good practices that most people can do most of the time, it’s like, this is safe, right? And we don’t tailor it or we don’t <span class=\"s2\">[cross- talking 18:11]</span> safe, right? And so, even if we do tailor them, sometimes we make bad tailoring decisions and it causes the system to break and all kinds of stuff, right? And so because Dean is trying to create certification, right, he’s codified all the stuff, right? And it’s a thing and it has released numbers and all these different things, more power to him, right? I mean, there’s good guidance in there and we work with safe shops all the time. Right? But it’s like, I mean Dean knows, right, I’ve had conversations one on one with Dean is that he knows that there’s an underlying organizational architecture required to support this, last I talked with him, it’s beyond the scope of what he’s trying to certify.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">18:52</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">No. I mean, I spoke to him on this podcast too and I asked him about that specifically and he’s like you know, like you said, if you have you know, somebody that doesn’t know what they’re doing, of course, they’re going to you know and he’s seeing those patterns but?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">19:07</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And he’ll come in and consult for you and customized model for you and do all those things. Right? So again, I think it’s high integrity but just like everything, right, in life it’s like, we take the surface level stuff and the biggest problem we see in the transformation space right now is you’re taking a reference implementation, overlaying on top of an organizational design that it wasn’t meant for, it doesn’t work or it doesn’t work as effectively as you would like it to.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">19:33</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And that’s why it fails, in a sense a lot of times, so maybe to tie this together, like you know, we’ve been saying or what I wanted you to kind of expand on is like, okay, organizational architecture is key. You have to have somebody on the business side, usually supported by the board to make a decision that we have to look at the whole organization and how it’s architected. Right? And then when we look at architecture, we have to understand that in order to deal with this type organization, the architecture can’t be fixed, it has to be contextualized for our own organization rather than just relying on a recipe, like treating say for any other framework, like a recipe. And then even though we don’t have half of the ingredients, we’re saying, let’s do the same, right?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">20:22</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yeah. Well, so sure, right? So, like the process, so like, one of the things that we’ve been unpacking for last couple years is we talk about the difference between like a system of delivery, right, that consists of reference architecture patterns and reference implementation details and then there’s a system of transformation. Okay, how are you going to implement it? There’s a third system we call, system and continuous improvement, which is, how are you going to sustain it and continuously adapt it? And then, you know, this is something that maybe, you know, a company wouldn’t put in but we call it, a system of engagement.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But it’s like, how are we going to start to build mindshare over time to get the organization to converge into these patterns. And so, a lot of the process for us is getting everybody aligned around the reference architecture patterns, picking a slice of the organization that wants to go and do this, con expedition and then we move it to a defined steady state. And for us, a lot of times and this is another thing that I think is hard for people get over, I was literally just talking with some of our developers this morning. And it’s like, sometimes at an early stage transformation in the presence of dependencies when things are not aligned as well as we would like them to, sometimes we have to put in compensating controls and we use the metaphor of like, scaffolding.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You know, I want to build a wall and I don’t want the wall to have a bunch of metal stuff around it. But while I’m building it and it’s hardening, I have to put some scaffolding around it. So, there’s a lot of things that we do in an early stage, depending on the organization that might be heavier and save as much grief as saved gets heavy and heavy. We’ll do things that are heavier than safe because they’re scaffolding. And then as we improve the systems underneath, there are systemic transformation, then you can start to dismantle the scaffolding.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">22:11</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I think I heard you talking, maybe you can expand on it here. Like, most of the organizations today, larger organizations are structured around capabilities. And a lot of times you might have to start with those capabilities and move them into value streams over time, rather than just quickly trying to organize by value streams.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">22:33</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yeah, so there’s an interesting journey that we’re starting to uncover, especially if we’ve been fortunate to work with some really large clients. And what you find is that, there’s a sequence to events that they like, A has to be true before b can be true before C can be true and so a lot of times you’ll walk in, and people aren’t even organized around business capabilities.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They’re organized around functional silos and there’s project management that stitching processes and resources and things like that, right? So again, all this depends upon the complexity of the organization, the size of the organization, like if you can walk in and you can reorganize around products or feature sets and they’re discrete and you know, that’s awesome, right? I’d rather do that first but a lot of these mega organizations, a lot of times they understand business architecture, they understand what their business capabilities are.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So as a first pass, you kind of think, okay, well, I’m organized around business capabilities because I can create complete cross functional teams are on those and I’m going to orchestrate the project work across, I’m going to deal with dependencies across business capabilities, it kind of becomes like a first pass. And then like on a second pass, now we’ve got a bunch of teams formed around business capabilities but the rub is going to be in and this is legitimate, that those dependencies left unchecked, drive orchestration costs up really high. So, because the orchestration is so high, it actually creates a business case for breaking dependencies and then as you break dependencies, you can regroup business capabilities into value streams.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">24:15</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So, it’s almost like you’re exposing the cost of dependencies and using that as a trigger or nudge to say, hey, you know, this is costing you.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">24:29</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">100%, yeah. Because like, you walk into organizations and I mean the numbers, I can remember 20 years ago when I first, maybe a little longer than that, when I first got into project management. You know, it seemed like if you were budgeting something like and again, I’m making this up, it was like maybe six developers, two testers, a project manager, maybe split across a couple teams or something like that. And now, it seems like you walk into places and like for every one developer, there’s two testers and three project managers and a BA and like, all this stuff, right? And it’s like, the complexity has gone up so much we have all these people run around managing complexity. And part of the challenge that we’ve got is, I think that’s just a function of bad org design, right and unnecessary complexity. So like, what starts to happen is that once you get the organizational design, right, you’re able to surface, not only the dependencies but the cost of managing those dependencies. And then what you can do is you can and I’m not saying that you have to lay people off but it’s like, you can redeploy those people into other higher value functions within the organization, rather than being scorekeepers. There’s just too many scorekeepers around in most companies that we deal with.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">25:41</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is crazy, so like, what you’re saying is like, not almost but I think it’s exactly, like if your organizational structure policies is not aligned, that can cost you. That can almost like, you know, a lot of times, it’s going to force you to fail because that’s a lot of times one of the underlying issues or impediments to having a more you know, product value, whatever you want to call it based on organization.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">26:15</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yeah, the other fascinating thing and I literally just previous, our as talking, we have kind of an emerging practice within our methodology group. It’s kind of like, the broad arc is methodology and then we have kind of product and business architecture and kind of within product, there’s a specialty that’s starting to emerge around finance and financial management. Because what we see a lot and I know this will resonate with you, it’s like, as you start to build out, even if you’re building out these little expeditions that are like team, program, portfolio, right, that kind of thing. It’s usually a layer, an audit and compliance type layer, governance layer that rides over all of this, that is still looking at three to five year plans and 18 months cycles and annual funding and all these different things. And you know, I think that is indeed an artifact of an organization that struggles to make any commitments, right?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So, they’re planning and scorekeeping and doing all these things, even at the highest levels of the organization and what’s been pretty cool. And these are some big names that we’re working with is that once you get the organization performance and it can make any commitments and it can deliver in small batches, then the next trick is to go up a layer and say, okay, how can we exploit this new organizational capability. So that we can make better bets and market, get faster feedback and be able to learn from what it is we’re doing because what my team is doing is, they were pitching a white paper they wanted to do with us. And you know, one of the things that we’re talking about was the idea that we’ve installed agile but we haven’t really and maybe we’ve even reduced costs and increase efficiency but we haven’t really maximized the product value or gotten to where we can actually put things in market and start selling them earlier. And again, that’s an artifact of the way we’re governing and doing audit and compliance and such is not congruent with the improved way that we’re doing software delivery or product delivery, you know right?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So, what are the steps necessary to be able to bring those top level functions into alignment with this new deployment capability. And the way that you’re going to maximize value at an enterprise level is to take your multi year annual planning cycles and to break them into some sort of quarterly cadence with quarterly funding, right? Where you can fund a quarter or maybe two, right, I’m not being super dogmatic, it’s probably not continuous at that level but I can fund a quarter release and maybe by the end of the second quarter, realize that maybe I’m not quite on track. And maybe I have the opportunity to go correct something in quarter two or pivot into quarter three and I actually become more adaptive and agile at the senior most levels within the organization. And I think that’s where the and again, in a mega organization with value streams that are global, I mean sometimes that’s where you got to start attacking.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">29:15</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That’s really interesting, I’m also interested to hear your thoughts, how do you move from funding capabilities or cost centers to funding value streams? Like, that also needs to happen at the highest level and that needs that shift, what have you seen and like, that’s working, that’s not working in that shift?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">29:38</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Well, like I said, right? I mean, I’m dealing in a world where I have people that this is their specialty. Right? And so, that might be a topic for another podcast to put vows of it. Right? But this is literally what Larry and I were just talking about, right? They’re hitting me with all this detail, right and I’m like, well really like if you think about it what we’re really doing is we’re trying to get them to break big projects into small projects and run the small projects on tighter cadence. Like, yeah that’s exactly it, I’m like, okay well, then sometimes we just need to say that, you know because that’s all it is. Right? So, how do you get them too, right I mean, it all comes down to understanding what their constraints are and what they’re trying to accomplish. And to be able to build a system that gives them what they need, is agile is sometimes and this is a reason why we came up with this little quadrant model and our base camps and expeditions and things like that, is agile is a lot of times what we want is, we want everything to be adaptive and emergent. And you know, it’s just like, just going to park it really fast.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yeah but if I’m building nuclear submarines or I’m building cars or I’m building missiles or I’m building large scale financial services, infrastructure, things like that, right and these are differently building websites or consumer products and things. And there’s lots of things that have to come together in order for that to be able to happen. And so like, one of the things that I talk about and I’ve done this for a minute, like the earliest revs of our website, say this right up at the top, it’s like most the time, like people aren’t using or they don’t aspire to use agile for like, hyper adaptability and exploration. What they’re really using Agile for is because they believe it will help them become more predictable and that’s why that tends to be the first step on the journey is because when you organize complete cross functional teams and you get them to establish stable velocity against a known backlog. And they get to a really clean definition of done at the end of every sprint, that is a much more reliable indicator of project progress than you know, Gantt charts and progress reports and all that kind of stuff, right? And so, we can do is we can use Agile concepts to actually get to a place where we can make any commitments more effectively than our traditionally managed counterparts.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Okay? And so now we have dedicated stable performance teams that we can count on, that are aligned to business capabilities or value streams or products, I can start to think about how to fund those things in a more stable way. Right? And now this need for predictability in control isn’t done by top down edict and rules and tight governance and things, it’s more like, fun, stable funding and periodic measurement of progress. And I believe, in order to have that conversation at the most senior levels, the necessary precondition is to be able to actually be a performance organization.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">32:59</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I mean, that reminds me of what you also described, like the almost the trust influence loop, it’s like, let’s deliver a first on let’s meet the organization where they are and meet that, you know and it’s almost like in order to help them evolve, you’re building that trust and you’re delivering them what they want and slowly.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">33:20</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The very first, the very earliest thinking this of this is like everybody, you know, this is like 15, 20 years ago, right? So like, everything I would hear would be like, you have to trust a team. Well, the ecosystems that they’re working in, their practices, their org design like, nothing lends itself to trustworthiness, right? And so, it’s like, what I would tell people is like, you’re asking these leaders to trust these teams but these teams have no track record of ever living anything on time. Right? And I was talking with one prospect one time and they’re like, well the executives need to stop asking us for dates, they need to stop giving a scope, they need to stop giving as much as you need to just give us a big pile of money and just let us do it whatever we want.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They didn’t say quite like that but that was certainly what they’re saying, right? And I’m like, okay like, seriously, if you were building a house or doing whatever, would you just give the contractor half a million dollars and just say, just go for, just do the best as you can? You’re the guy that’s close to the ground, you know what kind of house I need, like no, right, you want to know what you’re going to get for your money. And there’s some reasonableness, right, there has to be some ability to deal with variation and respond to change and exchange requests and things like that but you want some idea what you’re going to get for your money. Business owners are no different than matter, executives are no different than that, they want some reasonable controls to know they’re going to get pretty close. And so, if you’re going to go up to the most senior executives with some form of, you need to trust the teams, my belief is that you got to get the team’s trustworthy first.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You have to create the organizational design, you have to create the process, you have to create the metrics, you have to get instantiate, you have to be able to put stable inputs in and get stable inputs out. And this is all scrum basics from, I’m not saying I don’t think anything unethical, I mean, <span class=\"s2\">[unsure 35:01]</span> was writing about this stuff in his earliest works about basically how to deal with variation and process control. I mean, that was like early stage stuff, I mean, David Anderson’s been writing about this and Kanban and has Agile Management books.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">35:16</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I mean, that’s the whole lean, like in a sense, if you can manage the variance, you want to minimize the variance but sometimes, you know, right, it’s not as easy as you know, mass production plants and then things like that.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">35:29</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So, what the trust influence loop came in and so what we’re talking as that little, like that little figure eight thing on the side and it’s been a while since I’ve talked about it but like one of the things that we were talking about earlier is consultants. And I would say this is 100% true of internal change agents as well, is that there’s an influence loop, which basically goes something from like, you have access to somebody, you have to have empathy for their problem they’re trying to solve, you have to have a point of view that actually they believe will solve their problem and then you create safety for them. A lot of times, what we do is agile is, we come in and we say we know your problem, this is what you need to do to fix that. And then they go well, not quite my problem and even if it is my problem, it’s not the problem that has my pants on fire, right?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So it’s like, I’m not dealing with that right now and so this whole influence game is a game of access, empathy, point of view and safety. Right? So, you loop through that and then on the backside, the trust side is you get permission to do something, you have to do with integrity, you have to do with competence and you have to share results. Right? And so, there’s this virtuous cycle and so this is reason why part of what’s up underneath like this base camp model and the reason why we do incremental.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">36:42</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That’s what I wanted to hear, maybe you can talk about that next, which like, how does the base camp get the expeditions and how is it supported by that, trust influence problem?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">36:52</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So, you think about it, especially from like a marketing perspective, a sales perspective, an early stage engagement perspective to piloting and to roll out and to growing like a large account. And again, right, all this stuff, I’m a consultant, that’s the world I live in but even from a practitioner perspective, you’re doing the same things, right? There’s marketing, you’re selling, you’re getting started, you’re scaling, right, all these things. And there’s an influence game that has to be played, right, you have to tell a story that convinces somebody that this is worth doing and then once you do it, you have to get the results you promised. Right?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So if I say, hey, you’re going to get all this greatness from doing Agile and I train everybody on Scrum, I train everybody on safe and it ends up being a chaotic mess for three years. And you don’t get the results, like why would anybody continue to invest in that, right? It’s just a <span class=\"s2\">[unsure 37:38]</span> system at that point, right? And so, what we recognized very early on was two things and again, this is through the lens of a consultant, running a consultancy, is if we didn’t demonstrate tangible value really quickly, we didn’t get to stay for very long, right because, no, seriously, right?</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">37:57</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">No, I’m laughing because I’ve been in many of those situations and I know you’re sure most coaches and consultants have.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">38:04</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yeah, and it’s like, you go in, everything’s great. It’s like, it takes a minute, it was six months and you’re like, yeah okay, I can’t get the next tranche of funding. It’s great, man, I appreciate you, see you later, right kind of a thing? Or maybe you have some success but it’s just not mind blowing. Right? And so, the evolution of these expeditions, the base camps and so just to put into software language, like an expedition is like a slice. So, I think of an expedition is like an increment of the organization and then base camp is like an iteration. If you guys go back to like, you think about like Jeff Patton’s, Mona Lisa metaphor, which I think is just brilliant, right?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So for Dewey, he’s using it to describe incremental and iterative and he uses increments is like, okay, I’m going to take the Mona Lisa canvas, I’m going to split into six, I’m going to work on the upper left corner of it, right, that’s an increment. An iteration is like, taking it from like a sketch to a watercolor to an oil painting, kind of a thing. We’re making it more rich as we go and so like, we think of transformation incrementally and iteratively, as well. So, but we can promise typically and like a three to four month early stage engagement is we can take a slice of this organization, team level to portfolio, structure, governance and metrics, all the practices, culture, all that stuff and get it to a predictable state. And that’s what we promise and we can do that repeatedly in three or four months and then they go, wow, this is actually really working. And they go, okay, let’s do the next chunk and then the next chunk.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">39:38</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">What do you do in a sense like, when you’re taking those vertical slices, there’s almost like prerequisite to what they need to have in order to create that vertical slice, right? So, there’s some type of expectations that you set you know, if we’re going to do this, this is what we need from our organization to create that vertical slice.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">39:54</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yeah, so remember, I talked about system of delivery, system of transformation, system of engagement? So, from a system of delivery perspective, you’re building on patterns, reference architecture, filling in reference implementation details, things like that, right? So, we have a hypothesis of what this is going to look like at base camp one. And then we might have some idea of the first couple of slices and then the system of transformation is all about how you run the expedition to base camp journey. Right? So, we have outcomes, based plans and a bunch of guidance that we’ve evolved over time, right? So we’re going to move this slice into this known state but on the system of engagement stuff, which I think gets to your question is, the way we do that is we’ll get like all the leaders in a room and we’ll walk through, here’s the reference architecture, here’s the things that you’re going to have to do, here’s the things you’re going to have to overcome, here’s going to be the nature of your dependencies, here’s going to be your challenges. Now, are we 100% right, I think we got 80 or 90% of them.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The details of people in particular architecture issues are all going to be all over the place. I mean, there’s a lot of uncertainty but the patterns, the failure patterns are fairly known. So, we walk them through, we say this is your failure patterns, this is what’s going to happen, these are things we need to fix, this is how we’re going to do it. So, we start off with a workshop that brings everybody into a cognitive box and then we expand that box into a bigger piece of the organization, then you can go for breadth or depth or whatever and lots of different strategies. We do something called the find the end state, it’s usually about two months and we’ve got that scripted out too, we look at business architecture, technology architecture, org design, product architecture and literally create a team formation hypothesis. We put names in boxes, we help them figure out what tooling and instrumentation they’re going to use, we help them figure out what they’re going to measure, what they want to control, what success looks like, all those things, that takes a minute. And then what happens, then we create a plan for a pilot and then we’ll do a pilot and then the pilot is going to work back to all of those core things we’ve been talking about all along. And they’re going to see, okay, this pilot is going to go to Basecamp one and this is going to be the characteristics the organization, they’re going to build or make any commitments, they’re going to be able to deliver on quarterly boundaries, we’re going to be able to do it in a reliable, predictable way.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We’re going to have dependencies managed, we’re going to have economics trade-offs dealt with, we’re going to get value, right? The risk in this early stage, right, is that you build the engine and you get really good at building the wrong product. I mean, that can happen, right? So, now you’re in the stance of like, okay well, if we focus on building a product but we don’t have a delivery engine, is that better than building a delivery engine and not knowing what the right product is? Right? So, as we’ve kind of advanced, there’s a little bit of a dance right and in early stage, we might literally help them get better at building the wrong product but now they have the ability to start to deliver on regular paths. Right?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">42:53</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The right product.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">42:55</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And then as they start realizing, okay, I’m getting data now and I start to realize that we’re building that then, that’s when we might start introducing more product management practices. Or if we know we have dependencies, that we need to do like product extraction, technical decoupling, things like that, we might start laying, bringing in some more like XP software, craftsmanship coaches and start laying the foundations and building the capability internally so they know how to do red, green refactor, things like that. And so, we just layer these capabilities as we move them from predictability to smaller batches to fully encapsulated teams and so that’s how it works. Right?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">43:32</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So, maybe, just to pause on that because I think you know, we can take it lightly, like that’s how it works, that’s been my experience in a sense of how it works. But that takes a lot of effort on organization committing, the other big part that I would like to know from your perspective is, how do you make it sustainable? So, you bring coaches, consultants to help organizations realize this and then eventually, what you want them is, you want to work yourself out of the job, so they can do this long term. What are some of the things that you do and some of the challenges that you face because they think long term in our organizations to be able to deal with same type of issues that they dealt when they brought you in?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">44:17</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yeah. So, the metaphor that I use and they’re all systems metaphors, right? Is it leading Agile is like transformation in the cloud, right? And so, in an early stage transformation, you might subscribe to our services and we come in and we help you do all these things. But an any non trivial sized company, there’s two dimensions you have to deal with it, at some point they want to take that in the cloud service, they might want to make it like an on premise service, kind of thing. They might want to have their own instance of it. Okay? And so, typically on the lots of words but typically the word we use most commonly it’s like a setup like an Agile transformation office. And the Agile transformation office needs to have all the core services that Leading Agile has, right?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So, we’ll help them identify a playbook, will get a coaching and development services, like a talent service, a way to manage the transformation and Expedition readiness service, right? All these different services that we’ve got that are in Leading Agile, will help our client build them and then we’ll teach them how to run it. And then, you know, obviously, we’d like to maintain a presence to help sustain it and nurture it and things like that. But what we found and I know you know this, there are not enough Agile coaches or technology coaches in this world to help the companies that need to be helped, right? And so, I don’t believe, I don’t think there’s any scarcity in this and so like, one of our largest, longest standing clients we’ve invented a lot of this stuff with them, which has been a very cool relationship is we built an Agile transformation office with them. It’s their transformation office, they run it and at one point in time, I want to say, I had 45 consultants on the ground with them doing senior level transformation, leadership, Expedition leadership, we would call integration coaching, some specialists around product and finance and all those different things.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But at one stage, they had 250 coaches, they were on the ground doing team level stuff that were sourced all over the place. They were sourced from other consultancies, internal people and then over time, they started inserting their people in expedition leads and transformation and things like that. Right? As they started getting more confident in their ability to do it and then now it just kind of ebbs and flows, like if we’re going into like a gigantic company, right? So, you did the first 13,000 people and there’s hundreds of 1000s of people will have to go, right? And so, we’ll go into incubate another slice of the organization and we may be at this for 10 years or so. Because they want to go but what we’re leaving is we’re leaving behind the capability for them to sustain it themselves because we’ve instantiated the playbooks.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">47:17</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But also, you’re kind of you know, essentiated the playbooks, you’re developing the skill so they can develop and maintain and evolve those playbooks. Right? And what’s interesting is that I think, you know, based on what you’re describing and that’s why like, you know, I wanted to talk to you is like, that’s what it takes for organization to transform. And if we look at the last 10 years and we look at you know, Agile transformations, like 99% of them failed.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So, and that’s a huge number, it’s not like, you know, at least most of the organizations that I’ve been part of and the ones that have been part of, that have been successful is essentially what you’re describing. So, I’m curious to hear your thoughts you know, in a sense, like if that’s what it takes for organization to succeed and most organizations are not doing this. What are your thoughts? Like I mean, what do we need to do as a community, what do we need to do as coaches because it’s a big ask to do what you just described in here for organizations to be able to transform?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">48:23</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So here’s the thing that I think is, there’s a couple of factors, right? So, there’s like a belief factor and then there’s like a pragmatic reality factor. And so like the belief factor and this is the one thing I’ve been, I’m a little too extreme on this and I’m going to acknowledge this. But it’s like so many people in the Agile world, they lead with culture and they say, well, it’s a culture change and we need to change mindset, we need to change attitude and we need to change the way people behave and stuff like that and that’s true, right? But the reality is that, people are operating in broken systems.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Okay? And unless we get the systems that they operate in right and bring the process into congruence with the operating system or the structure this, yeah, right? It’s really difficult to ask people to change their minds, the way that I articulate is like, I have two salespeople and they’re both in the same region. And I want them to cooperate but I have them incented for, you get paid based on what you kill, I get paid based upon what I kill but they want us to cooperate. I can’t ask what to cooperate if our financial incentives are to compete. Okay? And so, we have to create the ecosystem, we have to change your org design, I have to change the process to encourage the collaboration that we want. So, I think leading with culture, it’s just the way I term to say but leading with culture I don’t think is a winning strategy.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">50:01</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I mean, it’s almost like, what less guys and what it’s like, you know, change the system, right? And changing the system will force you to change you know, the culture as a result of that you know, the practices would change. But here’s the trick, right, which I think is the biggest of them all. In order to do this, you have to have a leader with the mindset that is willing to change the system and if you don’t have that?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">50:30</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That’s the chicken and the egg problem, right? But I don’t need to get to change their entire leadership style. So, like a little bit of the way that you flip that influence, as you say, look, I get you have to make any commitments, you have to be financially responsible, you have to be a good steward of the resources, you have fiduciary responsibility, your stakeholders, all these things. I’m going to build you a system that’s radically different than what you’re doing today, that is going to achieve better results.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Are you willing to take a bat? Right? The other side of it is like, because and I’ve been in this world where there was a consultancy, where I kind of partnered with 10, 11 years ago. And this lady goes in and she’s like, telling all the leaders well, you need to change all of your behaviors, you need to be more empowering, you need to do this and they were just like, out, right? So it’s like, you got to like, it’s like the influence trusting you, you got to tell them the story they need to hear and then evolve their thing.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">51:26</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Exactly and I think that’s what’s so powerful what I liked, when I first heard about base camps and expeditions. It’s like, if somebody was asking me and saying like, Milan, you have to do this, I’ll be like, go f*** yourself. Right?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">51:41</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I didn’t know you could say that word on your podcast like I’ll be all down?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">51:44</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You can but you know, because in a sense like, you know that’s not, but if they’re actually walking me through and I say, this is what I want to do and they show me and help me and they say, okay, what do you, like it’s easier for leaders to do that. If they’re going through that type of and I think that idea of expeditions and base camps is?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">52:03</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yeah, I had a colleague in the industry and an Agile conference a couple years ago. Yeah, there’s a little bit of liquor involved, though, I’ll acknowledge that but we’re having this very intense conversations. She’s like we need to empower and trust your people and just let them decide and I’m like but it’s my money that pays their salary. If they jack up the account, I’m still paying their salary, regardless of whether they’re damaging your reputation and my economics and my family’s livelihood and all these things. And so like, a lot of it is like balancing between what’s sufficient control to make sure that we don’t lose the wheels on this thing versus empowering people to make local decisions. But you know, getting back to the question that you had asked me about like, what’s getting in the way? I lied with, we’re spending too much time on culture, right?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There’s still a big problem 20 years later, I think the other thing is, you said, what do we need to do with the community? I think pragmatically, this is the challenge, is that most people if they’re independent, are in a small company, they’re trying to make a living and they’re doing the best they can within the agency that you’ve been granted. So, a lot of times, they don’t have the span of control. Sometimes they don’t know how to go tell those executive stories. I mean, I have my team, could not sit in a conference room of the C level suite and tell those big stories, right?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">53:17</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Which goes back to that access, you can’t influence if you can’t.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">53:21</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yeah, well, you don’t get access, if you can’t influence, right. Yeah, for sure. Right? So, they tell a good story to a director or VP and maybe they make some good local changes but they don’t get the broad base changes that they need. I mean, it’s taken us 11 years to even get to the place where, I think I’ve had a pretty strong story and market but it’s taken me 11 years and I mean, there are more people that used to work for Leading Agile in this world and currently work for Leading Agile in this world. Our hypotheses on like, what are the right kinds of consultants and what do they need to know and what kind of work designed I put them in?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And what personality attributes do they need to have? I mean, like, we’ve changed everything, we reinvent this company every 9 to 18 months and it’s constantly evolving to solve this problem. And we were fortunate that we had enough early success and I was able to accumulate enough working capital that we can take chances and risks and build marketing teams, all these things go on, tell these stories. But what the thing that I actually can’t comprehend right now is why like the bigger consultancies don’t deeply understand the story because we, you know, obviously, almost anytime we go into an organization, there is a gigantic world class strategy firm in there or something like that. And what I find is that the strategy firms are making the same mistakes as small firms, a lot of times.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And so, that’s the thing, it’s a little mind numbing to me because they have business architecture practice, they have product construction practices, they have the ability to do this stuff. So then I have to believe that it comes down to their beliefs about what to do and what’s in their economic advantage. So, I think that there’s some belief stuff, I think there’s some structural stuff that’s getting in the way but I feel very fortunate the way we built this company is that we generally get to do work on our terms and get in. And so like, what happens is we market and tell stories and you’ve clearly read a lot of our content and the companies that resonates with, they call us, right, our phones ring. I’m on three to five sales calls a week, I’m not going to close everything, of course, <span class=\"s2\">[cross- talking 55:26].</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">55:25</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But like you said, there’s still more, there’s like you know, in a sense, there’s way too much work and there’s way too many companies that need the help. It’s just that like, that’s what kind of puzzles me too in a sense, where are we going to be like, in the sense that, you know, there’s been this whole buzz around Agile and it’s really failed, in a sense to really help organizations the way that the organizations need help.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">55:52</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The reason I think we’re still in the game and I think there’s still a conversation around it is because I think organizations recognize that it’s principally sound. And they believe that if they can crack the code, that will make them more successful and they’re right. But as a whole, we don’t have good operating models for how to get there.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">56:18</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Well, unified voice.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">56:21</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Or unified voice, well I’ll even say, you know and maybe this is you know, maybe somebody will get some nasty phone calls or emails as a result of saying this is, I actually think the Agile conferences are trending in the opposite direction. As I look at like, I’m probably not going to submit to Agile 2022 this year because I look at the tracks and you know, I mean these are important topics but it’s like a lot about it is diversity, equity inclusion, it’s about all these different things and again, all important stuff, right? And I’m not diminishing that in the slightest but I feel like the voice of okay, transformation and business architecture and doing this in a structure, I don’t think that’s what people want to hear. Right?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And I think to some degree, they want to deal with the easier issues and this is tough, right? Because as an individual practitioner, it’s tough to take what I say and go do it because you almost have to, I mean, I hate to say it’s self-serving but it’s like, you almost have to hire us to do it. Or you have to be like, really deeply entrenched in it and like, really understand it and you might have a shot but like I said, I’ve got a lot of <span class=\"s2\">[cross-talking 57:24].</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">57:24</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Well, that’s almost like, I use an analogy with the cooks and recipes and chefs, right? Like, it constantly has changing ingredients, so you can bring me in, if I’m a chef, you can bring me in to help you come up with the recipe. But what happens if you don’t have the ingredients, the same ingredients and I’m not there and you’re a cook that doesn’t know what they’re doing, you’re going to mess it up. So like, in a sense like, what we need is like, how do we develop more chefs in organizations and you know, that they can actually deal with whatever is given to them. Architect based on context, not just, hey, here’s a safe and we went through a four day training on safe or whatever, right?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">58:05</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So, here’s like, the interesting hard part, right? I have thought of the idea of like building a certification or building a program or something like that. But you think about it, you know, Jim kind of works with me and Jim was in the Scrum Alliance and really helped that organization make a lot of inroads into PMI and really took it from kind of a niche to and really kind of blew it up. And I think he would tell you directly, it’s like, people want to pay $1,200 or $800 now maybe and get a two day certification and they want for the resume, right and that’s a market and they want employment. And so, and I watched what the Scrum Alliance does with the advanced Scrum and things and it gets traction to a point but it’s like, the money is isn’t selling these <span class=\"s2\">[cross-talking 58:54]</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">58:56</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Like, I said the money is selling recipes and training people on recipes not creating chefs.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">59:02</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yeah, I used to get onto the marketing team at Version One because they want to say, they weren’t saying marketing agile made it easy on them. No, this isn’t easy, it’s hard. Right? And then so, I think they said Agile made it easier or something. And I get it, right, because it’s like, you need to sell an easy but it’s not easy. You know? So I’m like it’s team’s backlogs, working, tested software, if you can figure that out, it’s super easy. But getting the team’s backlogs, working software is taking us 11 years to figure out of that. So yeah, and we’re still figuring it out. Right?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I mean, I’ll be the first to say it’s like, I mean, I was telling the guys today we’re going to do a podcast and we’re going to just talk about stuff that’s just super exploratory. Because it’s like, we don’t have every answer, I think we’ve got the base patterns, right? And I think we have the principles right but the practices and the how tos are constantly emerging as we learn more stuff. You were talking to clients about using Agile to build the next rev of nuclear submarines and and you know, battleship and things like that and defense. Like, I mean, this is like cutting edge stuff that people want to use this for so that the industry still has poll, right? I mean, people want this, we just need more mature practitioners that understand how to apply these concepts in a less dogmatic way. So?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">1:00:16</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Exactly. And I think that’s going to be the trick, I know it’s been an hour and I feel like we could continue talking but I do have to go, <span class=\"s2\">[cross-talking 1:00:24]</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">1:00:24</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yeah, we should do this again sometime.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Speaker: Miljan Bajic<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">1:00:26</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yeah, definitely. What would you like to end with, like a message or invite or?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mike Cottmeyer<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></b><span class=\"s1\">1:00:30</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">No, I think where we left it is pretty cool, right? I mean, if anybody’s <span class=\"s2\">[inaudible 1:00:34]</span>, I mean obviously hit our website leadingagile.com, connect with me on LinkedIn. We’re super happy to answer questions and talk about this stuff. I mean, it’s kind of what I do for five hours a day is just talk to people, right? Whether it be my teams or clients or whatever and super passionate about this and if you’re in the market, you’re looking for a job, we’d love to have you reach out on our careers page. It seems like I got 20 or 25 open positions all the time and so for the right people, it’s a great place to be and we’re doing some really cool stuff.

I’ve seen firsthand that the Transformation is not as difficult for smaller organizations because there are fewer layers to work through. For larger businesses, it becomes more challenging.</p>\n<p>Becoming more Agile for large, well-established businesses is more than just a change for the IT organization; it has wide, sweeping implications. Particularly challenging are changes that involve learning a new way of being, like “becoming more agile.” When there is an intentional organizational change like an Agile Transformation, there is a significant learning curve, and it is an organization-wide shift.</p>\n<h3><strong>WHERE TRANSFORMATIONS CAN GO WRONG</strong></h3>\n<p>I’ve seen change initiatives go poorly. Raise your hand if you haven’t! There are times when even the most well-intentioned efforts fall on deaf ears, are met with resistance, and in some cases, sabotaged. There are hundreds of things that can go wrong. Us Agile folks tend to clump together, and a friend of mine often says he doesn’t have all the answers; instead, he is just running out of mistakes to make. I, too, sometimes feel that way.</p>\n<p>I worked with an organization that went all-in—in poker terms—with an Agile Transformation.  At the time, it looked like the Transformation would be isolated to just IT. But, as the Transformation progressed and did so quite well, I might add, new thinking led to new IT practices that directly impacted the business. The new IT practices created new business opportunities that did exist and, from a technical perspective, opened the organization to new markets. We had an opportunity to replace much of the outdated physical mailings (direct mail) the business did with a new system involving digital websites and email right when the market was ready for it. It would generate substantial cost savings and provide a significant expansion of the marketing capabilities of the whole company. Technically, we were poised to enter new markets with nascent technologies that could replace and automate many existing business capabilities. The market was ready; IT was ready. However, the business wasn’t ready yet.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">A mind convinced against its will is of the same opinion still. ~Unknown</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The business was not prepared for such a drastic change in how they engaged with their customer base. In IT, we made tremendous but isolated headway, peripherally including the business in the changes at the touchpoints that mattered to them. Waiting to socialize or even prepare the company for the changes made sense until we proved the technologies worked. There are good reasons for that, but in the end, lack of engagement, socialization, collaboration, and a systematic way to bring the business on board made the leap too challenging for them. It was a great idea, but it was too much to accept without making iterative changes to the existing business structures, and these changes should have been made in parallel with the IT transformation. In the end, the business did not change, which led to regression within IT. It didn’t take long for the whole IT organization to revert both practice-wise and culturally through attrition and other change.</p>\n<h3><strong>WHY CHOOSING THE RIGHT CHANGE INITIATIVE MATTERS</strong></h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, this is not an isolated example. Change initiatives often put cultural or practice changes first because some think the results are more predictable. But without structures to support new thinking, the change cannot maintain traction. Like a vehicle trying to climb an icy hill, we can get what looks like progress at first, only to slide back to the bottom of the hill when the wheels start slipping. The new culture needs something tangible to connect with, or momentum is lost, and the existing organizational structures eventually crush the change effort into submission.</p>\n<p>Change is challenging, and try as we may, it seems, we’re never fully prepared for every inevitability. There is no shortage of change management approaches either. Since change triggers our automatic “fight-flight-freeze” responses, we need to get ourselves, and others prepared and on board with what we are doing. Structures that facilitate change need to be in place. Execution is critical, as is learning and adjusting as we go, but, particularly with change at scale, structured preparation and socialization set the stage for success.</p>\n<p>Leaders need an effective way to help their organizations adopt Agile and adapt to change. Preparing for Transformation with leadership, teams, and all levels in-between is essential. Successful execution depends on effective preparation and socialization, particularly with the teams.</p>\n<h3><strong>THE PSTIR FRAMEWORK</strong></h3>\n<p>At LeadingAgile, we follow a 5 phase PSTIR Model to ensure systematic flow with leadership and the teams. The PSTIR Model: Prepare, Socialize, Tailor, Implement, Reinforce is an iterative approach to executing change. PSTIR is a change model that scales; from organizational-wide change to the change needed with individual teams.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-60099 size-large\" height=\"340\" src=\"https://www.leadingagile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/PSTIR-Blog-Img-Inside-Blog-604x340.jpg\" width=\"604\" /></p>\n<h3><strong>THE IMPORTANCE OF METRICS</strong></h3>\n<p>Metrics are also a crucial component to effective Transformation. Metrics provide the mechanism to enable feedback on the effectiveness of the structure and governance established during the Agile Transformation. They point out where to investigate possible impediments to delivery and where the teams might be effectively coached for improvement. The PSTIR Model, coupled with Outcomes Based Planning and rigorous tracking of progress with metrics, make iterative progress and effective management of the Transformation possible.</p>\n<p>Everyone in the organization needs to understand the <u>what</u> and the <u>why</u> behind a transformation, and PSTIR helps get buy-in. Transformation leadership needs to be immersed and fully engaged as we move through the Transformation. Teams, too, need to be fully involved as they will be called on to adopt new practices and help gather the data and artifacts that will demonstrate capabilities. This includes teams all over the organization: leadership, Transformation, Management, Investment, etc. Preparing for Transformation is an essential first step to producing desired organizational outcomes, and the PSTIR Model is a great way to accomplish the needed groundwork.</p>\n                    </div>\n</div><a href=\"https://engage.leadingagile.com/March-2022-Open-QA-Registration.html?utm_source=Why%20Change%20Management%20is%20Essential%20for%20Agile%20Transformation&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=RSS%20CTA\" style=\"display: block; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.leadingagile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/open-qa-email-newsletter.jpg\" style=\"display: block; height: auto; margin: 0 auto;\" /></a><img src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/collect?v=1&amp;tid=UA-20144799-2&amp;cid=1648299300&amp;t=event&amp;ec=RSS&amp;ea=open&amp;cs=Why%20Change%20Management%20is%20Essential%20for%20Agile%20Transformation&amp;cm=RSS_Feed&amp;cn=RSS_Opens\" />", "pub_date": "2022-03-21T09:00:25Z", "link": "https://www.leadingagile.com/2022/03/why-change-management-is-essential-for-agile-transformation/?utm_source=Why%20Change%20Management%20is%20Essential%20for%20Agile%20Transformation&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS%20Reader", "image": "https://frozen-brushlands-72168.herokuapp.com/staticfiles/imgs/agile_pm.png", "podcast_name": "", "guid": "https://www.leadingagile.com/?p=60097", "comment": "", "status": null, "star_rating": 5}}, {"model": "podcasts.newsitem", "pk": 2457, "fields": {"source_name": "Agile Alliance", "title": "Project Management for Healthcare Information Technology", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.agilealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/project-management-150x150.jpg\" width=\"150\" />", "pub_date": "2022-03-25T19:46:18Z", "link": "https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/books/project-management-for-healthcare-information-technology/", "image": "https://frozen-brushlands-72168.herokuapp.com/staticfiles/imgs/agile_pm.png", "podcast_name": "", "guid": "https://www.agilealliance.org/?post_type=aa_book&p=8081862", "comment": "", "status": null, "star_rating": 5}}, {"model": "podcasts.newsitem", "pk": 2458, "fields": {"source_name": "Agile Alliance", "title": "The Integrator, A Change Management Framework For Achieving Agile IT Project Success", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.agilealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/the-integrator-150x150.jpg\" width=\"150\" />", "pub_date": "2022-03-25T19:39:53Z", "link": "https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/books/the-integrator-a-change-management-framework-for-achieving-agile-it-project-success/", "image": "https://frozen-brushlands-72168.herokuapp.com/staticfiles/imgs/agile_pm.png", "podcast_name": "", "guid": "https://www.agilealliance.org/?post_type=aa_book&p=8081859", "comment": "", "status": null, "star_rating": 5}}, {"model": "podcasts.newsitem", "pk": 2459, "fields": {"source_name": "Agile Alliance", "title": "Agile Business: A Special Report in The Times", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.agilealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/times-header-150x150.jpg\" width=\"150\" /><p>Today, Agile Alliance is excited to share a special report on Agile Business, produced in partnership with Raconteur and published in The Times of London.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.agilealliance.org/agile-business-special-report-in-the-times/\">Agile Business: A Special Report in The Times</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.agilealliance.org\">Agile Alliance</a>.</p>", "pub_date": "2022-03-24T20:21:46Z", "link": "https://www.agilealliance.org/agile-business-special-report-in-the-times/", "image": "https://frozen-brushlands-72168.herokuapp.com/staticfiles/imgs/agile_pm.png", "podcast_name": "", "guid": "https://www.agilealliance.org/?p=8081815", "comment": "", "status": null, "star_rating": 5}}, {"model": "podcasts.newsitem", "pk": 2460, "fields": {"source_name": "Agile Alliance", "title": "Learning Over Delivery – How Companies Become Learning Organizations with Dojos", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"115\" src=\"https://www.agilealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/agile2021-400x115-1-150x115.jpg\" width=\"150\" /><p>Pull back the curtain on organizations’ strategic plans and you’re likely to find one or more transformation initiatives.

400;\">There’s a part of Transformation that’s essential that we don’t talk about as much—expenses. During Transformation, we mainly focus on variable expenses because those costs are negotiable. The most often overlooked variable expense during Transformation is external vendors, likely because they aren’t technically a part of your company.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s no surprise that companies don’t want to pay to Transform external vendors, in the risk that the people will leave after the contract is up, or the vendor won’t support the changes. But, even if they don’t make up a significant part of your workforce, they will stall your progress if they are unwilling to adopt your Agile way of working.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The external vendor we encounter the most—especially at large organizations—is contract employees. There’s an obvious benefit to contract employees because you can have a minimum number of staff and contract out the rest. The ratio will depend on the company and how they view their technology: is it a significant competitive advantage to invest in, or more of an expense? A company adopting Agile might be moving from IT being an expense to a strategic differentiator they invest more in during Transformation. It’s essential to understand your needs, how your vendors will fit into your Transformation goals, and what the relationship will look like afterward.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>The Weight of External Vendors</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if your external vendors only make up 20% of your workforce, that will weigh down your Transformation if they aren’t willing to get on board.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest issue is the financial weight of vendors. They’re an expense that you need to run your company, but when you’re transitioning to a new way of working, you’ll have to decide if you’re willing to train them or find new ones. Many external vendors are used to save money in the long run, but it might end up being a more significant investment you have to make. You can’t have your vendors working in opposition to your Transformation goals.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, there’s the risk of running into other issues that are common with external vendors. A high turnover rate negatively affects your predictability and costs you more money to keep training new people. If they lack the commitment to the vision and resist the changes, this can tank morale among your full-time employees and leave them questioning, “what’s the point?”.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, it’s critical that you have vendors that align with helping you achieve your goal of Agile Transformation and help you along the way, not hold you back. It should be a part of your Transformation plan to asses current vendors, get them on board, or invest in finding new ones that support your vision.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Turning Vendors into Assets</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> </strong>There are two options for handling vendors.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h5><u>Train Your Vendors</u></h5>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if your current vendors are willing to accept the training, you can encounter struggles there, too. They can be just as resistant to change as your full-time employees, not stick around for the long run, and depending on their current skillset, training could take a long time. This isn&#8217;t ideal if your goal is flexibility and saving money.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h5><u>Find New Vendors</u></h5>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look for vendors that better align with your needs. This can be tricky to navigate because there are different practices within Agile, and not every organization practices Agile the same way. If a vendor says they have Agile teams to offer, you need to ask detailed questions about how they operate to ensure their Agile mindset is the same as yours.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you ask how long their sprints are and they say “six months,” that’s not Agile. You need to get to the bottom of their understanding of Agile to be sure you’re on the same page. Unfortunately, some companies only say they do Agile as a marketing tactic and don’t follow the practice. The problem is that you probably won’t find ones that match exactly what you need and align completely with your Agile Transformation strategy.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h5><u>Work with LeadingAgile &amp; Our Studios Team</u></h5>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An option that we provide at LeadingAgile, we work alongside vendors, help train them, and show them the ropes of any Transformation we’re a part of. But in the best interest of our clients, we’ve found that having people who are well-versed in the LeadingAgile way of doing things is the quickest road to accelerate a Transformation and get our clients the help they need when they need it, and can ramp up that help or taper it off as the Transformation matures. This is why we set out to create a Studios offering of highly qualified developers who are ready to assist you in your Transformation and can hit the ground on day one with little to no onboarding and start adding value immediately.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that level of experience provided by your external vendors, they become an asset to your Transformation. They have gone through a LeadingAgile Transformation before, so they understand the structure, governance, and metrics of your Transformation and value the same things that you’re trying to get your organization to value. It takes the stress out of finding more vendors and can speed up the Transformation process to work with those who already know what they’re doing.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>The Impact on Transformation</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we don’t correctly leverage vendors, it becomes an anchor to Transformation. If you’re only spending time investing in how you want your software to be built and not building expectations with your teams and vendors, it will cause problems.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Addressing external vendors needs to be done across the organization as part of the larger picture of Transformation. Contracts should be updated with current vendors to cover changes made to your operations. For any bids made to new external vendors, be sure that the requirements are understood from the beginning. Get detailed in the contracts you present to these vendors, specifics like you want the code written in a certain language or automated tests in these places. Then, you only pay or accept the code when it passes your tests.

But change is hard and people tend to resist it. The thing is what derails Transformation isn’t actually your teams and executives not wanting to change, more often it’s that they don’t actually see how to get from point A to B safely and pragmatically.</p>\n<p>All they can see is the magnitude of what must happen. The impediments, the dependencies, and resistance—and they don’t know what to do about it all.</p>\n<p>But if you can provide a pragmatic roadmap, or plan of attack for how to deal with dependencies, overcome resistance, and clear organizational impediments, you’ll find your people and executives are actually very willing to change and will buy into it.</p>\n<p>In this video, Mike Cottmeyer explores what’s required to create an Agile Roadmap so the organization can get a really clear plan for what kinds of changes are going to be made, when, how to get started and get executive buy-in, who is going to <a href=\"https://go.leadingagile.com/agc\">make the changes</a>, what to expect along the way.

Len is a Principal Consultant at LeadingAgile and he has a background in sociology. As Len explains, “The most difficult challenge in delivering great products is getting people to work together.&#8221; During the interview, we explore emotional systems theory and how that can be applied within our organizations and teams to create sustainable change and deliver great products.</p>\n<p>The Bowen Family Systems Theory was developed by Dr. Murray Bowen. It is rooted in taking a systems view in studying families and the relationship patterns that develop between family members. Bowen’s theory and the eight concepts that came out of it can also be applied to the workplace and the emotional systems we create and participate in day to day. The better you are able to understand these systems, the more able you will be to foster systems that lead to a positive outcome for your team, your organization, and your customer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif; font-weight: 100;\"><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/leadingagile\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LeadingAgile\">LeadingAgile</a> · <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/leadingagile/emotional-systems-theory-and-leadership\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Emotional Systems Theory and Leadership\">Emotional Systems Theory and Leadership</a></div>\n<p><strong>Links from the Podcast</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bowen Family Systems Theory: <a href=\"https://www.thebowencenter.org\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.thebowencenter.org</a></li>\n<li>Johari Window: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window</a></li>\n<li>A Failure of Nerve by Edwin Friedman  <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Cxc6dD\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://amzn.to/3Cxc6dD</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Contacting Len Greski</b></p>\n<p>If you’d like to contact Len, you can reach him at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>LeadingAgile: <a href=\"https://www.leadingagile.com/guides/len-greski/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.leadingagile.com/guides/len-greski/</a></li>\n<li>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/leonardgreski\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://linkedin.com/in/leonardgreski</a></li>\n<li>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lgreski\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/lgreski</a></li>\n<li>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/lgreski\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/lgreski</a></li>\n<li>Email: <a href=\"mailto:Leonard.greski@leadingagile.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Leonard.greski@leadingagile.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Contacting Dave Prior</b></p>\n<p>If you’d like to contact Dave, you can reach him at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>LeadingAgile: <a href=\"https://www.leadingagile.com/guides/dave-prior/\">https://www.leadingagile.com/guides/dave-prior/</a></li>\n<li>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrsungo\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrsungo</a></li>\n<li>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrsungo\">https://twitter.com/mrsungo</a></li>\n<li>Email: <a href=\"mailto:dave.prior@leadingagile.com\">dave.prior@leadingagile.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have a question you’d like to submit for an upcoming podcast, please send them to <a href=\"mailto:dave.prior@leadingagile.com\">Dave.</a></p>\n                    </div>\n</div><a href=\"https://engage.leadingagile.com/WCT-Studios-WP-2022.html?utm_source=Emotional%20Systems%20Theory%20and%20Leadership&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=RSS%20CTA\" style=\"display: block; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.leadingagile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/software-dependencies-website-banner-1.jpg\" style=\"display: block; height: auto; margin: 0 auto;\" /></a><img src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/collect?v=1&amp;tid=UA-20144799-2&amp;cid=1670182233&amp;t=event&amp;ec=RSS&amp;ea=open&amp;cs=Emotional%20Systems%20Theory%20and%20Leadership&amp;cm=RSS_Feed&amp;cn=RSS_Opens\" />", "pub_date": "2022-10-19T19:19:12Z", "link": "https://www.leadingagile.com/podcast/emotional-systems-theory-and-leadership/?utm_source=Emotional%20Systems%20Theory%20and%20Leadership&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS%20Reader", "image": "https://frozen-brushlands-72168.herokuapp.com/staticfiles/imgs/agile_pm.png", "podcast_name": "", "guid": "https://www.leadingagile.com/?post_type=podcast&p=60811", "comment": "", "status": null, "star_rating": 5}}, {"model": "podcasts.newsitem", "pk": 2495, "fields": {"source_name": "Agile Alliance", "title": "Keeping it real with BDD", "description": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"115\" src=\"https://www.agilealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/agile-tech-talks-featured-400x115-1-150x115.jpg\" width=\"150\" /><p>Business and tech people often speak different languages, which makes sense because they have different mindsets.

But the librarians aren&#8217;t buying these databases only for themselves.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, they&#8217;re buying them for high school students. Students who don&#8217;t have a master&#8217;s degree in Library Science, who probably don&#8217;t know or care about Boolean searches because they&#8217;re used to using Google.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you only considered the economic buyers&#8217; wants, do you think you&#8217;d end up building a suitable database? Do you think your database would get widespread adoption from the end users, a.k.a. the students you and the librarians were hoping to get?</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Probably not. On the contrary, if you assumed that the buyers&#8217; values matched those of the end users, you&#8217;d likely look back and see this product as a total fail.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>&#8220;No one&#8217;s using our product? But why?&#8221; </em><em> </em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>&#8220;If only we knew what we needed to build ahead of time, we could&#8217;ve built the right thing the first time.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This library database scenario exemplifies how making a big assumption, even in a relatively short decision chain, can disrupt your ability to deliver a high-quality product that will delight your customer.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This same type of scenario plays out in business all the time, too. But, in business, we often deal with more significant decisions, longer decision chains, truckloads of more money, and people&#8217;s livelihoods on the line. The fallout of making a poor decision about the product you&#8217;re building can get costly from both a human and financial perspective, so it behooves us to figure out some way to get it right.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, there&#8217;s a way to weed out poor product assumptions early in the build process to mitigate risk, reduce waste, and save some dollars and heartache along the way.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But first, let&#8217;s look at how product assumptions can creep into our work.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Product Fit: The Hunt for Red Herrings </strong></h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We&#8217;re unsure how red herrings became synonymous with a false or misleading clue. Maybe if we had some sort of advanced Boolean search to help us find the answer—wait, erm—we&#8217;ve been down that path already, haven&#8217;t we? Alright, we don&#8217;t have to go there again.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But product assumptions are, in fact, red herrings, though. They lurk inside your organization, just waiting to sabotage your product, and they can come from many different locations: sales, marketing, Ops, finance, you name it. Heck! Even talking to your actual customers sometimes isn&#8217;t safe.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sales may say, &#8220;Look. Our competition has 20 features, and we only have 10. We look bad by comparison, and it seems to be a sticking point in most of my calls. We&#8217;ve got to build in more features. Pronto!&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or marketing might tell you, &#8220;Hey, bud. We&#8217;ve been doing market research, and the customers are looking to solve problem X, and they want this very specific feature that&#8217;s incredibly heavy and complex. Still, we think you need to build it because, hey…the customer is always right.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or even worse, maybe your SVP ambushes the teams one day and exclaims, &#8220;Everyone! Today is a new day for us. We will begin the launch of <strong>Our Product 2.0</strong>! It came to me in a vision last night as I lay there deep in my slumber. It&#8217;s going to be great! Just. Trust. Me.&#8221; *commence eye rolls*</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay, that last one might include a little hyperbole, but you get the point. These assumptions can come from anywhere, at any time. But you know the old saying about assuming, right?</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Are All Product Assumptions Good or Bad? </strong></h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> </strong>But Derek? But David? Aren&#8217;t we supposed to be innovative and inventive so that we might push the boundaries of the market to keep up with our competition?</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Glad you asked. Absolutely. You want to be both innovative and inventive in a competitive marketplace. And especially in new markets. We&#8217;d even go as far as saying that in new markets, sometimes all you have are assumptions and hypotheses.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, it&#8217;s not that all assumptions are good. And it&#8217;s not that all assumptions are bad. It&#8217;s the wrong question to ask. The truth is that assumptions are reality. Often necessary.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, the question is how we can create a product roadmap enabling us to test our assumptions. How do we get fast feedback from the people who matter to ensure we&#8217;re investing our time, energy, and dollars into the right places, at the right time, to release the most value into the market and get the most ROI?</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And how do we do these tests and get the feedback at scale without losing our ability to be Agile?</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because if you&#8217;re not asking the right questions and thinking about your products in investment increments, you&#8217;re doing it wrong, and you&#8217;re going to run into product fit issues. And product fit issues lead to rework or, worse, tearing it all down and starting from scratch.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&#8217;s a lot of wasted time and money. Not to mention a lot of unhappy customers.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the only people you end up delighting are your competition.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your competition? They love to see you fail.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> </strong><strong>The Product Strategy You Want &amp; Need </strong></h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> </strong>How do you<em> not</em> delight your competition and delight your customers instead?</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s easy. Make smaller bets.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, what do we mean when we say make smaller bets? We mean that it&#8217;s always easier to build more. You can always add a feature later. But if you&#8217;ve already built it, you can do nothing to get that time, effort, and money back.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Agile, the delivery organization inside your business strives to reduce batch size and deliver an increment of working-tested product that has some value to the business or its customers at the end of every sprint.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your product organization must work similarly. The product organization can&#8217;t say we&#8217;re going to build this suite of features based on these hypotheses, then turn around and wait eight months before a customer ever gets a chance to lay eyes on it. That&#8217;s Waterfall.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our experience, most people hip to Agile understands the Dev teams&#8217; work intuitively. Epics decompose into features. Features into stories. The work flows through some tiered governance model. The delivery teams are rapidly putting increments of tested products on the market. Typically, we see some automation to mitigate the risk of escaped defects. Pretty standard.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But how do you do that with a product assumption? The names and faces may look a little different for product organizations, but they have the same principles. We&#8217;re looking to quickly get a lightweight version of the assumption—an MVP if you will—in the market. We want to validate that assumption with real people as fast as possible and then apply what we learn to the next batch of work.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>How Agile is Your Product Organization? </strong></h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want your product teams to be more Agile, there are three critical categories they should focus on: prioritization, prototyping, and metrics.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><u>Prioritization  </u></strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most organizations don&#8217;t lack ideas. There are a ton of ideas inside every organization. And when you have a ton of ideas, you need a way to prioritize them that isn&#8217;t just a gut feeling. You need a methodology that uses metrics and data to help you decide what to build and when to build it.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every organization is different, but your criteria might be something like Business Value to the organization + Business Risk Metric + Level of Validation Required = Proceed or Holdoff. Whatever your specific criteria are, you must have a way to marry the art and the science of product development to ensure you make the appropriate level of investment.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a company full of ideas, people are going to have opinions. And developing a methodology to prioritize what you&#8217;re going to build will enable you to keep the feelings out of it, have value-based conversations as a team, and ultimately make better decisions for the business.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><u>Prototyping </u></strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember when we were talking about an MVP assumption earlier? That&#8217;s what prototyping is. Things inevitably cost more as they move down the product line. The goal of prototyping is to create the most realistic façade of the product you can without actually building it so that you can get feedback from your customers.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think about the old-timey towns in Western movies from the 60s. The sets would only include the fronts of the buildings. As an audience member, you got 10% of the buildings but 90% of the experience. We&#8217;re doing the same thing.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We want to give our customers 90% of the experience. Just enough usability. Just enough navigation options. Just enough so we can see how they interact with it and use it when left to their own devices.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can prototype in Photoshop, PowerPoint, Keynote, InVision, or Figma. Regardless of how you build a prototype, it needs to be lightweight, cost-effective, and take up the least amount of bandwidth possible from the rest of the organization.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you validate your assumption with the customer, you can begin the technical work, get Ops involved, and Support when necessary. You want to be careful you&#8217;re not jumping down the product line too early.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><u>Metrics </u></strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Metrics are tricky due to every organization&#8217;s unique structure, values, risk tolerance, and current reality. That said, understanding things like feature development cost, customers gained, feature usage, and revenue are safe bets, regardless of the organization. Mileage may vary on all of these, but the point is that you need to have a way of understanding what success looks like.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And if you&#8217;re only measuring features built or hours spent—those don&#8217;t have any business value, so they&#8217;re hard to get excited about and don&#8217;t mean anything at the end of the day.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>The Benefits of Agile in Product Organizations</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alright, we&#8217;ll admit it. We said delighting your customers was easy, but maybe it&#8217;s easier said than done. It&#8217;s going to take some planning. But it&#8217;s worth it. Here&#8217;s why.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you nail prioritization, begin prototyping like a boss, and have tangible business metrics to tie it back to—it&#8217;s like you&#8217;ve discovered this new hidden superpower. Suddenly, you&#8217;re stacking cash, keeping stakeholders happy, providing your teams meaningful work, and ultimately delivering products your customers crave.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And happy customers are always the number one hallmark of any successful business.</p>\n                    </div>\n</div><a

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the last decade, automation has become the norm for most organizations. And if they aren’t fully automated, they are going toward becoming fully automated. DevOps automates the process that connects development to operations, and now that DevOps tools are easy to get your hands on, most people want to be able to say they’re doing it. When you can get a tool to accomplish what it used to take teams full of people to do, and the cloud boosts that process even more, it can seem like a no-brainer to jump on the bandwagon so you can stay competitive and efficient. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the end, DevOps is about getting your teams to get software out the door faster. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trouble is that what we see in many organizations now is that they’re using DevOps automation because it’s “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> thing to do,” rather than a thing to do that’s tied to a particular reason or business value. So it seems like everyone is doing the right thing, but the truth for many of these organizations is that they’re just going through the motions of these technical practices without a purpose. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s great to have a DevOps initiative. But what are you doing? Why are you doing it? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Because we should do DevOps” is not a good answer.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you trying to get software into production faster?</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you trying to reduce defects?</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you trying to get your teams to work with fewer dependencies?</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What you want to do is actually connect your technology to the real business problems you need to solve. Solve the problems you need to solve and then you can get ROI for adding this automation in the first place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without knowing your &#8220;Why,&#8221; all you’re doing is aiming for completeness. “We do DevOps.&#8221; That&#8217;s it? If </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that’s the case, then you won&#8217;t have any leverage to have future conversations with the business and leaders about why they should invest in more automation or technology. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t Do DevOps for the sake of DevOps. Do DevOps for the sake of solving a business problem.</span></p></blockquote>\n<h3>What Are You Trying to Achieve?<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So when you want to take on a DevOps initiative, you need to start by figuring out what you’re trying to do. What’s your goal? What business value do you need to get from it? If you know what you’re trying to do and then scope your DevOps effort to that, you can begin to see the ROI you get from using technology to solve real business problems. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the 6 most common DevOps goals we see: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Predictability</strong>. You want to reliably make and meet commitments to your customers, plus build trust with internal stakeholders, customers, and markets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Quality</strong>. Ultimately you want to get the right features and functionalities released, reduce defects and reduce technical debt so you don’t erode trust and keep a good reputation with customers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Early ROI.</strong> You want to be able to charge for the product sooner, and realize revenue faster. Usually this means building for automation and working in smaller increments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Cost Savings.</strong> You want to release more at a lower cost and focus on real business problems that offer the highest value. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Innovation.</strong> You can’t innovate if you aren’t freed up to explore what works.Ultimately software development slows down as soon as you’re afraid of change. You want to make sure you’re always moving forward. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Product Fit.</strong> You want to know you are building the right product for your customers. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To do this, you need to be able to get quick feedback and change directions quickly to suit any changes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coincidentally, these are the same goals organizations usually have for Agile Transformation. </span></p>\n<h3>Bridging the Technology-Agile Gap</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In recent years as more companies begin to take on DevOps initiatives during Transformation, we’ve found that they’re increasingly constrained by a lack of people with the necessary skills to deliver the type of technical results required. So companies have to make the decision to slow down their Transformation and reduce business value until they can close the gaps between Agile Transformation and DevOps. But Transformations don’t need to be put on hold. There are other ways to solve the problem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to seeing this, we created LeadingAgile’s Studios to address and close these gaps so our clients maintain Transformational momentum by maximizing both velocity and value while the business invests in its employees, grows, and continues Transforming. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do we do this? We make shifts organizationally to ensure your teams are cross-functional and can work autonomously. But when you change your teams, your code doesn’t just change itself,  you have to also change the way you write your code. The catch is that once you change your teams and the way you write code, you’ll have more dependencies. And if you want to be Agile, you have to manage those dependencies or break them. If you have unmanaged dependencies, you won’t have Agility, all you’ll have is continued chaos. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So to make Agile and DevOps work, we start by orchestrating and putting in compensating controls to start managing the dependencies until we can break them. LeadingAgile has a journey we put clients on with measurable steps through what we call Basecamps, a reference architecture in 5 incremental phases. When we move into the last 3 phases of Transformation, where the team is encapsulated and software is too, DevOps becomes easier because it doesn’t have to move the whole world to get one thing done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We use Agile to stabilize the system we created to make all this work. But at some point there’s only so much you can do with organizational design, reducing batch size, and improving release plans. Unless you can start to remove dependencies and have teams operate autonomously, you are only as Agile as your dependencies will allow you to be. </span></p>\n<h3>Aim Toward Outcomes</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, if you want DevOps to work and you want Agile to work, both of them need to be aimed at solving real business problems. Doing either one just because it’s the thing to do will not get you where you want to be.

We’ve taken practices that worked in that room but overlayed them on top of organizations that aren’t teams in a room with the autonomy to change their software.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And because of that, we hear whispers that “<em>Agile doesn’t work anymore.”</em></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We get it. Organizations that adopt Agile have a lot on the line. They do it because they think it will increase their product delivery time, reduce mistakes, make them more predictable, get an edge on the market, and respond to customer feedback and changing demands. The list goes on.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only that, but they also invest thousands or millions of dollars and months or years in doing it. So, they lose money and sometimes even their jobs when it fails. There isn’t much forgiveness when leaders make promises of success to an organization that they can’t deliver on.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem isn’t that Agile doesn’t work. We’ve proven that it works if you do it right. The problem is that adopting Agile alone is not enough. You can’t simply put Agile practices on top of an organization not set up for them to succeed. And when you do that, Agile will fail every time.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We must also adapt Agile to a changing technology landscape and work environment. More often, teams are not working in a room together, and customers aren’t either.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Agile to remain successful, we must remember the core principles and shape the organization to adapt to make those things work the way the world is now.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>What Made Agile Work in The Beginning</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Agile officially began with the Manifesto in 2001 and was designed to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Empower developers</li>\n<li>Increase development speed</li>\n<li>Working processes focused on the user</li>\n<li>Ability to adapt</li>\n<li>Quick response to customer feedback</li>\n<li>Small autonomous teams</li>\n<li>In a room with their customer</li>\n<li>Constant iteration and testing</li>\n<li>Local apps on local servers</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of this small scope of software development, it was easy for small teams to operate with autonomy. They had a small, controlled environment they deployed into that only they had access to. The security requirements were minimal, as were the places where the applications needed to be deployed.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, in 2001, people were still getting started with personal computers, and though they were becoming more and more common in households, not everyone had one. The amount of technology and software required to support it was minimal compared to what it is today.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the last 21 years, Agile has remained successful for those who still remember its core principles. The problem we’re facing now is that the technology landscape has evolved, and so has the way we work.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To adapt Agile to work today, we still have to remember that what makes Agile work is setting up the systems and the structure of the organization to be successful. No amount of culture change or practices will work if the underlying systems are not there first.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>How Technology Has Changed &amp; Its Impact on Agile</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fast forward to today, and the complexity of software and the problems we are solving are much broader. This leads to the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Teams can’t encapsulate software development.</li>\n<li>Dependencies between teams</li>\n<li>Teams operating separately from their customers and markets</li>\n<li>Lag in response to customer feedback</li>\n<li>Inability to react quickly to market changes</li>\n<li>Delay in deploying and re-iterating software</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, we are also deploying applications differently—to the cloud. This enormous scope of deployment creates more obstacles resulting from technological advances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Requires more robust security</li>\n<li>Specific development skills</li>\n<li>More moving parts that work together</li>\n<li>Cloud needs to work anywhere, anytime, on any device</li>\n<li>Code and user experience suffer</li>\n<li>Increasingly difficult to consider the whole ecosystem of deployment</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the performance scale is much larger, and the stakes are much higher, there’s increased risk involved from a financial standpoint. In a world where everyone is constantly online, one application launch failure can result in consumers rejecting the application altogether.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, consumers are more ruthless than ever, and though feedback is essential, there are so many applications on the market that consumers might not wait for you to fix yours.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, while software needs to be moving quickly, so do the teams developing the software. It means that organizations need to create the conditions for speed and autonomy in team pockets.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem is that they don’t always do that. They don’t make the conditions for teams to operate correctly. They don’t build backlogs. They don’t encapsulate teams because the problem scope is too large for them to do that.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They adopt Agile into an ecosystem where it can’t work, but they blame it when it doesn’t.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Haven’t we learned yet that Agile practices aren’t successful without the systems to support them?</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Agile won’t give you the leverage you think it will in the market without overhauling an organization, restructuring teams, and fundamentally changing the work environment. Agile is not a quick fix, as much as people want it to be.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> </strong><strong>How We’ve Adapted Our Approach Over the Years</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Establish Software Development &amp; Agile Transformation Knowledge</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first adaptation we’ve made is to establish our knowledge and experience surrounding software development, Agile Transformation, and how the technological landscape has changed. We’ve learned a lot from working with clients over the last 12 years as a company and people whose experience began way before that. We acknowledge that things aren’t the same as they were 21 years ago, and we have created special teams to help tackle software challenges. We have also gathered groups of incredibly knowledgeable people who understand how Agile works on the ground and how to implement it in many different-sized organizations. We also know where it can commonly go wrong and how to help.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Leading with Empathy in Client Engagements</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arguably the most important thing we do is lead with empathy in every client engagement.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We don’t just walk into an organization and demand things be changed because we said so.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s essential to establish empathy about the problems the organization has faced and wants to solve, especially if they tried implementing Agile before and failed. The stakeholders and executives involved in those types of Transformations will be hesitant, have trouble trusting our process, or be skeptical that we can make it work for their organization—but there’s a reason they bring us on board.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of their hesitation, we need to develop a trusting relationship. We listen with empathy for their problems and where things go wrong, work to deeply understand what matters to them, and create transparency for the process ahead.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Build Trust and Influence with Key Stakeholders</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To build trust and influence, we develop a relationship of communication and transparency every step of the way. While these stakeholders may not be involved with the day-to-day teams, software development, and training, they must be in the loop to support their people.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The better leaders can understand what needs to change and why the more influence they will have in getting their people to change. Many Transformations fail to include executives and key stakeholders in the minutiae, thinking they don’t need to know when it couldn’t be further from the truth. Because they influence their organization, they will have more power to affect lasting change.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, our strategy has adapted over the years to encompass the changing technological landscape, with teams to handle software Transformations and organizational Transformations. This is the complete package of what Agile requires today to set up the foundations and systems for Agile to succeed.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Agile Still Works If You Do It Right</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the industry, we still see people beating the culture first or practices first drum. But we know from experience that no amount of culture or practice change will Transform a broken system. To achieve sustainable Business Agility, you have to change the system first.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the system is not set up to support small autonomous teams, weed out impediments, break dependencies, allow for constant iteration, and work within designated sprints to completion, no amount of daily process or culture boost will help.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cultural change may seem like it works at first, but when things don’t actually change, morale will tank, and people will go back to doing things the way they always did. The same goes for practices. If they aren’t producing results, what’s the point?</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with that, we must continue to consider the current state of technology, how we build, deploy, and iterate software, how people use it, and what the consumers want. We must make the systems work with how and where people want to work. We are shifting to a lot of remote work, which will probably be the norm well into the future.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the world becomes increasingly digital, we must adapt our approach to ensure that Agile’s core principles are honored and set up to work.
