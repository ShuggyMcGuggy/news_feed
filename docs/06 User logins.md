# Adding user accoutns and login
- Use the startapp command to create a new app called users
- Edit settings.py to add the app.
- Modify urls.py to include the users URLs
- Create urls.py in the users directory
- Import the django login model and define the login page url patterns
- Create a users/template/ users directory and create the login page

The login function has changed: Need to use the Auth modeul in ython and the login.html now has to be
in the directory registry.

Need to chanegt the url patternt to pick up the inxex pahe as home and 
Hopage as alternate
